<br /><span class="h2line2">THE RUNAWAY.</span></h2>
<p>I was standing on the deck of the <i>Seagull</i>,
looking over the rail and peering into the moonlight
that flooded the bay where we lay at anchor,
when the soft dip of an oar caught my ear.</p>
<p>It was the softest dip in the world, stealthy as
that of an Indian, and in the silence that reigned
aboard ship I stood motionless, listening for a
repetition of the sound.</p>
<p>It came presently&mdash;the mere rustle of the drops
as they slid off the oar&rsquo;s blade&mdash;and a small boat
stole from the shadows astern and crept to our
side.</p>
<p>I glanced along the rail and saw, a few paces
away, the dim form of the watch, alert and vigilant;
but the man knew I was there, and forbore
to hail the mysterious craft below.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>At a snail&rsquo;s pace the boat glided along our side
until it was just beneath me, when I could see a
blot in the moonlight that resembled a human
form. Then a voice, so gentle that it scarce rose
above the breeze, called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahoy, mate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now I ought to explain that all this was surprising;
we were a simple, honest American
merchant ship, lying in home waters and without
an element of mystery in our entire outfit. On
the neighboring shore of the harbor could be
seen the skids from which the <i>Seagull</i> had been
launched a month before, and every man and boy
in Chelsea knew our history nearly as well as
we did ourselves.</p>
<p>But our midnight visitor had chosen to steal
upon us in a manner as unaccountable as it was
mysterious, and his hail I left unanswered while
I walked to the landing steps and descended
them until I stood upon the platform that hung
just over the boat.</p>
<p>And now I perceived that the tub&mdash;for it was
little else&mdash;was more than half full of water, and
that the gunwale rode scarce an inch above the
smooth surface of the bay. The miserable thing
was waterlogged and about to sink, yet its occupant
sat half submerged in his little pool, as
quiet and unconcerned as if no danger threatened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; I demanded, speaking rather
sternly.</p>
<p>The form half rose, the tub tipped and filled,
and with a gentle splash both disappeared from
view and left me staring at the eddies. I was
about to call for help when the form bobbed up
again and a hand shot out and grasped a rope
dangling from the landing stage. I leaned over
to assist, and the fellow scrambled up the line
with remarkable agility until I was able to seize
his collar and drag him, limp and dripping, to a
place beside me.</p>
<p>At this time I was just eighteen years of age
and, I must confess, not so large in size as I
longed to be; but the slender, bent form of the
youth whom I had rescued was even of less
stature than my own. As he faced me in the
moonlight and gave a gasp to clear the water
from his throat, I noted the thin, pinched features
and the pair of large, dark eyes that gazed with
pleading earnestness into my own.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, what are you up to?&rdquo; I
asked, impatiently; &ldquo;and how came you to be
afloat in that miserable tub? It&rsquo;s a wonder you
didn&rsquo;t sink long before you reached our side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; he replied in a low voice. &ldquo;Are
you&mdash;are you Sam Steele, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! I hoped it would be you. Can I go
aboard, sir? I want to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not well have refused, unless I consigned
the fellow to the waters of the bay again.
Moreover, there was a touching and eager appeal
in the lad&rsquo;s tones that I could not resist. I turned
and climbed to the deck, and he followed me as
silently as a shadow. Then, leaning against the
rail, I inquired somewhat testily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you wait until morning to pay me a
visit? And hadn&rsquo;t you enough sense to know
that old dinghy wouldn&rsquo;t float?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it did float, sir, until I got here; and
that answered my purpose very well,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;I had to come at night to keep from being discovered
and recaptured.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! You&rsquo;re a criminal, then. Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, sir. I&rsquo;m an escaped cabin-boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That made me laugh. I began to understand,
and the knowledge served to relieve the strain
and dissolve the uncanny effect of the incident.
An escaped cabin-boy! Well, that was nothing
very wonderful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, come to my room and get some dry
togs,&rdquo; I said, turning abruptly to the gangway.
The lad followed and we passed silently through
the after-cabin, past the door of Uncle Naboth&rsquo;s
quarters&mdash;whence issued a series of stentorian
snores&mdash;and so into my own spacious stateroom,
where I lighted a lamp and carefully closed the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; I exclaimed, pulling some of my
old clothes from a locker, &ldquo;slip on this toggery at
once, so your teeth will stop chattering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He discarded his dripping garments and replaced
them with my dry flannel shirt and blue
trousers, my thick socks and low shoes. I picked
up his own ragged clothes and with a snort of
contempt for their bedraggled and threadbare
condition tossed them out of the window into the
sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and clutched at his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. I thought at first you had thrown
away mother&rsquo;s picture; but it&rsquo;s here, all right,&rdquo;
and he patted his breast tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; He gave a shiver, as if he had just
remembered this condition; and I brought some
biscuits and a tin of sardines from my cupboard
and placed them before him.</p>
<p>The boy ate ravenously, washing down the food
with a draught of water from the bottle in the
rack. I waited for him to finish before I questioned
him. Then, motioning him to a seat on
my bunk, for he seemed weak and still trembled
a bit, I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, tell me your story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Texan,&rdquo; he replied, slowly, &ldquo;and used
to live in Galveston. My folks are dead and an
uncle took care of me until a year ago, when he
was shot in a riot. I didn&rsquo;t mind that; he was
never very good to me; but when he was gone I
had no home at all. So I shipped as a cabin-boy
aboard the <i>Gonzales</i>, a tobacco sloop plying between
Galveston and Key West, for I always
loved the sea and this was the best berth I could
get. The Captain, Jose Marrow, is half Mexican
and the cruelest man in the world. He
whipped me when he was drunk, and abused and
cuffed me when sober, and many a time I hoped
he would kill me instead of keeping up the tortures
I suffered. Finally he came up here with a
cargo, and day before yesterday, just as he had
unloaded and was about to sail again, he sent me
ashore on an errand. Of course I skipped. I ran
along the bay and hid in a lumber shed, from the
top of which I could watch the <i>Gonzales</i>. She
didn&rsquo;t sail, because old Marrow was bound to
have me back, I guess; so I had to lay low, and
all the time I was sure he&rsquo;d find me in the end
and get me back. The sloop&rsquo;s in the bay yet,
sir, only about a quarter of a mile away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, last evening a couple of men came to
sort some of the timbers, and I lay hid on top the
pile and listened to their talk. They spoke of the
<i>Seagull</i>, and how it was to sail far away into the
Mediterranean, and was the best built ship that
ever left this port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true enough, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they said Cap&rsquo;n Steele was the best man
to work for in the merchant service, and his son,
Sam Steele&mdash;that&rsquo;s you, sir&mdash;was bound to make
as good a sailor as his dad, and had been in some
queer adventures already, and was sure to find
more of them before he was much older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to smile at that evident &ldquo;taffy,&rdquo; and my
smile left the boy embarrassed. He hesitated a
moment, and then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a poor devil like me, sir, such a tale made
me believe this ship a floating paradise. I&rsquo;ve
heard of captains who are not as cruel as old
Marrow; so when the men had gone I decided
to get to you in some way and beg you to take
me aboard. You see, the Mexican is waiting to
hunt me down, and I&rsquo;d die sooner than go back
to his terrible ship. If you&rsquo;ll take me with you,
Mr. Steele, I&rsquo;ll be faithful and true, and work
like a nigger for you. If you won&rsquo;t, why, just
say the word, and I&rsquo;ll jump overboard again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can you swim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; I asked, finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Herring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Joe, you&rsquo;re asking something unusual,
I must say. I&rsquo;m not the captain of the <i>Seagull</i>,
but merely purser, or to be more exact the secretary
to Mr. Perkins, the supercargo. I own a
share in the ship, to be sure, and purchased it
with money I made myself; but that fact doesn&rsquo;t
count when we&rsquo;re at sea, and Captain Steele is
the last man in the world to harbor a runaway
member of the crew of a friendly ship. Indeed,
your old master came aboard us this morning, to
inquire about you, and I heard my father say
that if he set eyes on you anywhere he&rsquo;d let Captain
Marrow know. As he never breaks his
word this promise is to be depended upon. Do
you see, now, what a fix you&rsquo;re in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>His voice was low and despondent and he
seemed to shrink back in his seat into an attitude
hopeless and helpless.</p>
<p>I looked at the boy more closely, and the appeal
in his pinched features, that had struck me
at the first glance on the landing stage, became
more impressive than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was tall, but miserably thin. His brown
hair, now wet and clinging about his face, curled
naturally and was thick and of fine texture,
while his dark eyes were handsome enough to be
set in the face of a girl. This, with a certain
manly dignity that shone through his pitiful expression,
decided me to befriend the lad, and I
had an inspiration even in that first hour of meeting
that Joe Herring would prove a loyal follower
and a faithful friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sail at ten o&rsquo;clock, and it&rsquo;s now past midnight,&rdquo;
I remarked, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I&rsquo;ll go any time you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t swim, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Don&rsquo;t let me be a bother to you.
You&rsquo;ll want to turn in,&rdquo; casting a wistful look
around my pleasant room, &ldquo;and so I&rsquo;ll find my
way on deck and you needn&rsquo;t give me another
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said I, nodding. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll
turn in this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose up, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just climb into that upper berth, Joe, and go
to sleep. There&rsquo;ll be work for you tomorrow,
and you&rsquo;ll need to get rested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stared into my smiling face a moment with
a startled look that soon became radiant. Then
he broke down and cried like a baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, no snivelling!&rdquo; I growled, savagely.
&ldquo;Pile into that berth; but see you get your shoes
off, first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed, still blubbering but evidently struggling
to restrain his sobs. Indeed, his privations
of the past two days, half starved and hunted like
a dog, had completely unnerved the poor fellow.
When he had tumbled into the berth I locked the
door, put out the light, and rolled myself in my
own blanket.</p>
<p>A few moments later I heard Joe stirring. He
leaned over the edge of the bunk and murmured:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, Sam Steele! I&rsquo;ll never forget,
sir, the way you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, shut up and go to sleep, Joe,&rdquo; I cried.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve kept me awake long enough already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; And after that he was silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">OUR VENTURE.</span></h2>
<p>Those who were present at the launching of
our beautiful new <i>Seagull</i> were unanimous in declaring
her the trimmest, daintiest, most graceful
craft that had ever yet floated in the waters of
old Chelsea bay. Her color was pure white, her
brass work brilliant as gold. She was yacht built,
on the lines of the fast express boats, and no expense
had been spared in her construction or
fittings.</p>
<p>My father, Captain Steele, one of the ablest
and best known sailors on the Atlantic coast, had
personally supervised the building of the <i>Seagull</i>
and watched every step of progress and inspected
every bit of timber, steel, or brass, so that nothing
might be slighted in any way. She was one
hundred and eighty-seven feet in length, with a
thirty-six foot beam and a depth of twenty-one
feet, and her net tonnage was close to fourteen
hundred. We had her schooner rigged, because
Captain Steele believed in sailing and had designed
his ship for a merchantman of the highest
class, but of the old school.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Uncle Naboth and I, who were also part owners
of the ship&mdash;the firm being Steele, Perkins &amp;
Steele&mdash;had begged earnestly to convert her into
a modern steamer; but my father angrily resented
the suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name&rsquo;s the <i>Seagull</i>,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;an&rsquo; a
seagull without wings &rsquo;ud be a doggone jack-rabbit;
so wings she mus&rsquo; have, my lads, ef Dick
Steele&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to sail her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had really put a fortune into the craft, and
Uncle Naboth&mdash;a shrewd old trader who marked
the world as it moved and tried to keep pace with
it&mdash;was as anxious to have the ship modern in
every respect as I was. So we stood stubbornly
side by side and argued with the Captain until he
finally granted a partial concession to our wishes
and consented to our installing an auxiliary
equipment of a screw propeller driven by powerful
engines, with the express understanding that
they must only be used in case of emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a rank waste o&rsquo; money, an&rsquo; takes up
vallyble room,&rdquo; he growled; &ldquo;but ef so be you
ain&rsquo;t satisfied with decent spars an&rsquo; riggin,&rsquo; why,
git your blarsted ol&rsquo; machinery aboard&mdash;an&rsquo; be
hanged to ye both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This consent was obtained soon after my return
from Panama, but Uncle Naboth and I had
ordered the engines months previously, having
been determined to install them from the day the
<i>Seagull</i> was first planned; so no time was lost in
getting them placed.</p>
<p>You will know the <i>Seagull</i> more intimately as
my story progresses, so I will avoid a detailed description
of it just now, merely adding that the
ship was at once the envy and admiration of all
beholders and the pride and joy of her three
owners.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>My father had sailed for forty years and had
at one time lost his right leg in a shipwreck, so
that he stumped around with a cork substitute.
But he was as energetic and active as in his youth,
and his vast experience fully justified his reputation
as one of the ablest and shrewdest seamen in
the merchant service. Indeed, Captain Steele was
universally known and respected, and I had good
reason to be proud of the bluff old salt who owned
me as his son. He had prejudices, it is true, acquired
through many strange adventures at sea
and in foreign parts; but his heart was simple
and frank as that of a child, and we who knew
him best and loved him well had little fear of his
stubborn temperament.</p>
<p>Naboth Perkins, my dead mother&rsquo;s brother,
was also a remarkable man in his way. He knew
the sea as well as did my father, but prided himself
on the fact that he &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t navigate a
ferry-boat,&rdquo; having always sailed as supercargo
and devoted his talents to trading. He had been
one of my earliest and most faithful friends, and
although I was still a mere boy at the time the
<i>Seagull</i> was launched, I had encountered some
unusual adventures in company with quaint, honest
Uncle Naboth, and won certain bits of prize
money that had proved the foundation of our
fortunes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>These prize-winnings, converted into hard
cash, had furnished the funds for building our
new ship, in which we purposed beginning a conservative,
staid career as American merchantmen,
leaving adventures behind us and confining
ourselves to carrying from port to port such merchandise
as might be consigned to our care. You
will hear how well our modest intention was
fulfilled.</p>
<p>The huge proportions and staunch construction
of the <i>Seagull</i> would enable her to sail in any
known sea with perfect safety, and long before
she was completed we were besieged with proposals
from shippers anxious to secure our
services.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth, who handled all such matters
for our firm, finally contracted with a big Germantown
manufacturer of &ldquo;Oriental&rdquo; rugs to
carry a load of bales to Syria, consigned to merchants
there who would distribute them throughout
Persia, Turkey and Egypt, to be sold to
American and European tourists and carried to
their homes as treasures of Oriental looms.</p>
<p>It was not so much the liberal payment we
received as the fact that the long voyage to the
Syrian port would give us an opportunity of testing
the performances of the <i>Seagull</i> that induced
Mr. Perkins to accept the contract and undertake
the lengthy voyage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>&ldquo;If she skims the Atlantic an&rsquo; the Mediterranean
all right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the boat&rsquo;ll weather
any sea on earth; so we may as well find out at
the start what she&rsquo;s good for. &rsquo;Sides that, we&rsquo;re
gittin&rsquo; a thunderin&rsquo; price fer cartin&rsquo; them rags to
Syria, an&rsquo; so the deal seems a good one all
&rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father gravely approved the transaction.
He also was eager to test the powers of our
beautiful new ship, and this would not be his first
voyage to the Orient, by any means. So the
papers were made out and signed and as soon as
our last fittings and furnishings were installed
and our crew aboard we were to voyage down the
coast in sunny September weather and anchor in
the Chesapeake, there to load our cargo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Our ship&rsquo;s company had been carefully selected,
for the fame of my father&rsquo;s new vessel
and the popularity of the Captain himself attracted
to us the best seamen available; so we
had the satisfaction of signing a splendid company
of experienced men. In addition to these
sailors we shipped a first and second engineer,
clever young fellows that became instantly unpopular
with my father, who glared at the poor
&ldquo;mechanics&rdquo; as if he considered them interlopers,
if not rank traitors. Some of the seamen, it was
arranged, would act as stokers if the engines
were called into requisition, so with the addition
of a couple of oilers who were also carpenter&rsquo;s
assistants we were satisfied we might at any
time steam or sail, as the occasion demanded.</p>
<p>I am sure Captain Steele had already acknowledged
in his heart that we were justified in
equipping the <i>Seagull</i> with engines, since any old
salt fully realizes the horror of being becalmed
and knows the loss such a misfortune is sure to
entail in time, wages, and grub. But he would
not admit it. Instead, he persisted in playing the
part of a much injured and greatly scandalized
seaman. It would be time enough to &ldquo;take
water&rdquo; when the value of the propeller was fully
proved.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Ned Britton was Captain&rsquo;s Mate, of course.
Ned had sailed with my father for years; he had
also sailed two exciting voyages with Uncle Naboth
and me, and we all admired and respected
this strong, gallant fellow as much as we had
come to trust in his ability.</p>
<p>Two other curious characters were established
fixtures of any craft that the firm of Steele, Perkins
&amp; Steele might own. These were two stalwart
black men named Nux and Bryonia, South
Sea Islanders whom Uncle Naboth had rescued
from death years before and attached to his
service. Since then they had become my own
trusted friends, and more than once had I owed
my life to their intelligence and faithfulness.
Bryonia, or Bry, as we called him, was a famous
cook, and always had charge of our ship&rsquo;s galley.
With Bry aboard we were never in want of a substantial,
well cooked meal; for, as Uncle Naboth
was wont to declare: &ldquo;Thet Bry could take a
rope&rsquo;s end an&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; tarpaulin an&rsquo; make a Paris
tubble-de-hoot out&rsquo;n &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nux was cabin steward and looked after our
comforts aft with a deftness and skill that were
wholly admirable. These blacks were both of
them shrewd, loyal, and brave, and we knew we
might always depend upon their fidelity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>On the morning following my adoption of Joe
Herring I left the runaway locked up in my stateroom
and went on deck to watch the final preparations
for our departure. A fair breeze swept
down the bay, so at ten o&rsquo;clock we hoisted anchor,
spread our main and foresails and, slowly gathering
way, the <i>Seagull</i> slipped through the water on
her maiden trip amid the shouts of hundreds who
stood on the shore to watch and bid us God
speed.</p>
<p>We fired a shot from our small howitzer as a
parting salute to our friends, dipped our pennants
in gallant fashion, showed our heels, and sped
away so swiftly that the harbor was soon left far
behind.</p>
<p>We passed the old <i>Gonzales</i> soon after leaving
our anchorage. It was still waiting to recapture
its absconding cabin-boy, though why Captain
Marrow should attach so much importance to the
youth I could not then understand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>As soon as we were well at sea I liberated Joe
and told him he was to be my special servant and
assistant, but must also help Nux to look after
the cabin during his spare time&mdash;which was likely
to be plentiful enough. Knowing that the sooner
I established the lad&rsquo;s footing aboard the easier
it would be for us both, I sent him on an errand
that would take him past my father&rsquo;s station on
the deck. His sharp eye encountered the boy at
once, as I had expected, and he promptly roared
out an order for him to halt.</p>
<p>Joe stopped and saluted respectfully. He was
looking cheery and bright this morning; indeed,
a different boy from the one I had pulled from
the sinking dinghy the night before. Life bore a
new aspect for Joe and his heart was light as a
feather. He looked honest and wholesome
enough in the fresh blue suit I had given him, and
he had been duly warned that his only remaining
danger lay in not winning the countenance of
the skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? &rsquo;N&rsquo; where &rsquo;n&rsquo; thunder&rsquo;d you
come from?&rdquo; demanded Captain Steele.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Herring, sir. Master Sam&rsquo;s assistant,
sir,&rdquo; answered the boy, in his quiet tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assistant! Bungs an&rsquo; barnacles! Assistant to
Sam! What doin&rsquo;? Loafin&rsquo; an&rsquo; a-killin&rsquo; time?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;I beg to refer you to Master Sam, sir,&rdquo; was
the composed answer, although from where I
watched the scene I could see that Joe was badly
frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Sam needs is suthin&rsquo; to do, more &rsquo;n a
grub-devourin&rsquo; assistant,&rdquo; pursued my father,
sternly. &ldquo;Look here; did my son lug you
aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, sir,&rdquo; replied Joe, truthfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send him to me, then,&rdquo; ordered my father.</p>
<p>I stepped forward at once, saluting the Captain
with my usual deference. When we were
at sea I had been taught to put by the fact that
this was my father, bearing in mind only the
immediate fact that he was my commander. Still,
in my capacity as secretary to Uncle Naboth I
was in a measure independent of ship&rsquo;s discipline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What tricks are you up to now, Sam?&rdquo; demanded
the Captain, scowling at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, this boy was the runaway from the
<i>Gonzales</i>, whom Captain Marrow has been seeking
so earnestly. He was so abused by the dirty
Mexican that he would rather die than return to
his slavery. So he threw himself on my mercy,
and knowing he would surely be retaken if I left
him ashore, I brought the lad with us. Don&rsquo;t
blame him, sir. I&rsquo;ll take all the responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>The Captain stared at me a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that you do, then,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Sam,
it&rsquo;s a illegal an&rsquo; unperfessional act to harbor a
runaway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usually no good ever comes of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an honest lad, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain eyed him closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no affair o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo; he muttered, half turning
away. &ldquo;The boy belongs now to the Perkins
outfit, mind you. I&rsquo;ll have no runaways ner
stowaways in my crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew then the battle was won, and that my
father would refuse to surrender Joe to his old
captain under any circumstances. The &ldquo;Perkins
outfit,&rdquo; so sneeringly referred to, meant Uncle
Naboth and myself, and although it was evident
the mission of the <i>Seagull</i> was dependent on the
&ldquo;Perkins outfit&rdquo; to manage and arrange its commerce
in a profitable manner, it pleased my father
to denominate us landlubbers and consider us of
&ldquo;no &rsquo;count&rdquo; in the sailing of the ship.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Uncle Naboth wasn&rsquo;t aboard yet. He had
gone by rail some days before to Philadelphia to
attend to the business of our cargo, and it was
not until we anchored in the placid waters of the
Chesapeake that my uncle appeared, smiling and
cheery as ever.</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins was short and stout, with a round,
chubby face, smoothly shaven, and a circle of
iron-gray locks around his bald head. His eyes
were small, light blue and twinkling; his expression
simple and childlike; his speech inelegant
and with a humorous twist that rendered him an
agreeable companion. But as a trader Naboth
Perkins was famed far and wide; his shrewdness
was proverbial; his talent for bargaining
fairly marvelous; his honesty undisputed. I
have heard merchants say it was a pleasure to
pay Mr. Perkins his demands, even though they
could procure the same service elsewhere at less
cost. For he was square as a die, faithful to the
smallest detail, and his word was absolutely to
be relied upon. The little old gentleman was
known as a money-maker, and had been the partner
of my father, his brother-in-law, for many
years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>Such a character could not fail to be eccentric,
and Uncle Naboth&rsquo;s ways were at time puzzling;
but I knew he was devoted to me, since he had
proved this quality many times; and I naturally
regarded my whimsical uncle with great affection.</p>
<p>When Mr. Perkins came aboard he announced
that the bales of rugs were all on the dock and
ready to load without delay. I was much interested
in our queer cargo, for it seemed strange to
me that Americans should ship &ldquo;Oriental&rdquo; rugs
to the Orient, to be purchased there by Americans
and brought back home again. But Uncle
Naboth, who had been through the mills at Germantown,
explained the matter very clearly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t enough
genooine Oriental rugs left to supply the demand,
now thet they&rsquo;ve got to be sich a fad with rich
people. When the Orient was fust diskivered
there was a good many rugs there, but it had
took years to make each one of &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; some was
so old they had holes wore in &rsquo;em; but that made
&rsquo;em the more vallyble &rsquo;cause it proved they was
antiques. They picked &rsquo;em up fast, an&rsquo; the
Orientals was glad to sell &rsquo;em an&rsquo; say nothin&rsquo;.
Ev&rsquo;ry tourist thet goes to the East wants to buy
rugs to send home, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll pay &rsquo;most any price
that&rsquo;s asked fer rare ol&rsquo; patterns an&rsquo; dim, washed-out
colors. Ef there&rsquo;s a few holes, badly mended,
so much the better, fer they proves the rugs is
old. So the clever Easterners an&rsquo; the cleverer
Yankees hit on a scheme to supply the demand,
an&rsquo; here in Germantown they makes thousands
of rare ol&rsquo; Oriental rugs every year. They buy
a few genooine ones to copy the patterns from,
an&rsquo; they weave &rsquo;em by machinery. Then the new
rugs is put into a machine that beats dust an&rsquo; dirt
into &rsquo;em an&rsquo; beats it out again, till the new, fresh
colors gits old an&rsquo; faded. After this they&rsquo;re run
through a rubbin&rsquo; machine that wears &rsquo;em down
some an&rsquo; makes a few holes, here an&rsquo; there; an&rsquo;
then the menders take &rsquo;em an&rsquo; darn the holes. In
about a day&rsquo;s time one o&rsquo; them rugs goes through
about as much wear an&rsquo; tear by machinery as it
would get in centuries of use; an&rsquo; fer my part I
can&rsquo;t tell the diff&rsquo;rence atween a genooine Oriental
an&rsquo; a imitation one. We&rsquo;ve got a whole
cargo to take to Syria, an&rsquo; in a few months
they&rsquo;ll mostly come back agin, an&rsquo; be laid on the
floors of our millionaires. Queer traffic, ain&rsquo;t it,
Sam? But if you stops to think, there&rsquo;s been
enough Oriental rugs carted out&rsquo;n the Orient, in
the last hundred years, to carpet most of Asia
an&rsquo; Africa with; so it stands to reason they ain&rsquo;t
all the real thing. If it wasn&rsquo;t fer Yankee ingenooity
an&rsquo; Oriental trickery the supply&rsquo;d been
exhausted years ago, an&rsquo; our people&rsquo;d hev to
carpet their floors with honest, fresh rugs instead
o&rsquo; these machine worn imitations. That would
break their hearts, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>But Uncle Naboth had arranged also to carry
another queer line of merchandise on our voyage,
consisting of several large cases consigned by a
Connecticut manufacturer. These contained imitations
of ancient Egyptian scarabs (a sort of
mud beetle considered sacred by the old sun-worshippers),
and a collection of funeral figures, tiny
household gods and other articles supposed to be
found only in the tombs of the primitive kings
and nobles of Egypt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Egyptian gov&rsquo;ment,&rdquo; explained Uncle
Naboth, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t let any more genooine relics be
taken out&rsquo;n the country, &rsquo;cause they wants &rsquo;em
all fer the Cairo Museum; so the Yankees hev
come to the front agin, an&rsquo; made mud relics by
the bushel, so&rsquo;s the eager tourists can buy what
they wants to bring home an&rsquo; prove they&rsquo;ve been
there. These cases o&rsquo; goods is consigned to merchants
in Luxor, a little town up the Nile, an&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ve agreed to run over to Alexandria, after we&rsquo;ve
unloaded our Syrian rugs, an&rsquo; dump the rubbish
on the dock there. There ain&rsquo;t many cases of it,
but the profits is so big that we get well paid for
the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did these wares get to Philadelphia
from Connecticut?&rdquo; asked my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve been correspondin&rsquo; with ol&rsquo; Ackley,
the Yankee that makes &rsquo;em, fer some time,&rdquo; said
my uncle, &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t tell how much room
the rugs would take up until I got here. When
I found I could stow the Egyptian rubbish, I telegraphed
to Ackley an&rsquo; the consignment got here
by freight yesterday. But that ain&rsquo;t the worst
of it, partners.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the worst?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the Yankee manufacturer has sent me
his beloved son, with a letter askin&rsquo; me to carry
him with us to Egypt, so&rsquo;s he can study the country
an&rsquo; find out what ancient relics they need
supplied in large quantities, an&rsquo; collect from the
dealers fer this first batch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t take passengers,&rdquo; said my father,
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I said; but the young duffer is here, an&rsquo;
won&rsquo;t take no fer an answer. He says he&rsquo;s willin
to pay fer his passage, an&rsquo; his dad wants him to
keep an eye on them precious modern antiquities
as we&rsquo;re to carry. So I&rsquo;ve put the case up to you,
an&rsquo; you can decide it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none o&rsquo; my business, Naboth,&rdquo; said my
father, turning away with a frown; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
passengers, but you an&rsquo; Sam can do as you please.
Only, if you take him, keep him out o&rsquo; my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle winked at me, and I knew the passenger
would be booked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Work of loading the cargo progressed rapidly,
and in two days the bales of rugs were all aboard
and carefully stowed in our dry and ample hold.
Then the Yankee antiques for Egypt appeared
for loading, and with them came a youth whose
appearance caused me to smile involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Archibald Ackley, Jr., Middletown, Conn.,&rdquo;
his cards read. He was a stocky, well built fellow
about seventeen years of age, although he
evidently wished to appear much older. He had
sharp gray eyes, lanky hair of light tow color, immense
hands and feet, a swaggering gait, and a
style of dress gay enough to rival the plumage
of a bird-of-paradise.</p>
<p>Archibald&rsquo;s features might have been handsome
originally, but a swiftly pitched base-ball had
once ruthlessly pushed his generous nose against
his left cheek, and there it had remained.</p>
<p>The youth sported a heavy watchchain that
was palpably plated, a big &ldquo;diamond&rdquo; on his
cravat that perhaps came from the famous &ldquo;Barrios
mines,&rdquo; of New York, and his fingers were
loaded with rings of vast proportions set with
doubtful gems. It may be Mr. Ackley, Jr., imagined
himself an exquisite, and sought to impress
people by a display of wealth that may have cost
him or his father several dollars; but, as I said,
my first glimpse of his gorgeous person caused
me to smile&mdash;an impertinence I quickly tried to
repress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Mr. Perkins and I considered carefully the
young man&rsquo;s request for a passage to Egypt, and
as we had ample accommodations we decided to
take him along; but when he came for his answer
and I caught sight of him for the first time,
I almost regretted our decision.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth, however, seemed not to be disagreeably
impressed. He shook the boy&rsquo;s hand&mdash;it
was a &ldquo;flipper,&rdquo; all right&mdash;with cordial greeting
and said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Archie, my lad; we&rsquo;ve talked it
over an&rsquo; you can go &rsquo;long ef so be you want to.
But remember this is a merchantman, an&rsquo; no passenger
ship, an&rsquo; make up your mind to abide by
Cap&rsquo;n Steele&rsquo;s rules an&rsquo; reggleations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; said the boy, evidently pleased.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not likely to bother any one. All I want is
a berth to sleep in and three square meals a day.
How&rsquo;s the feed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we have hearty appetites, ourselves, my
lad, an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s no call for you to starve as I
knows on,&rdquo; with a wink at me. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll eat at
our table an&rsquo; have the best the ship affords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want,&rdquo; said Archie, nodding
his bullet head; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing too good for
me. What&rsquo;s the price for the passage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty steep figure,&rdquo; he rejoined, uneasily.
&ldquo;I can take an ocean liner for about the
same cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your privilege, sir,&rdquo; I said, stiffly. &ldquo;We
don&rsquo;t want passengers; so we don&rsquo;t want you.
But Mr. Perkins is disposed to accommodate you
because your father is one of our shippers. Go or
stay, as you like; but make up your mind quickly,
for we sail at seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scowled first at me and then at uncle; but
presently he grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a choice,&rdquo; said he, carelessly. &ldquo;Pop&rsquo;s
paying the shot, for he wants me to keep an eye
on the scarabs and things and see the goods safe
landed and the money collected for them. They&rsquo;re
shipped to a lot of dirty Arabs who can&rsquo;t be
trusted. So here&rsquo;s your money, and I&rsquo;ll mail the
receipt for the passage to Pop before we skate
away, so he&rsquo;ll know it&rsquo;s you who are robbing him
instead of me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>I felt like punching the cad&rsquo;s nose, but Uncle
Naboth laughed good naturedly and nodded approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s businesslike an&rsquo; to the point,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;Take the money, Sam, and give our passenger
the proper receipt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did so, and Archibald Ackley, Jr., stalked
away down the dock to fetch his baggage from
the hotel.</p>
<p>To my surprise the <i>Gonzales</i> made the harbor
that afternoon and anchored alongside us. I
promptly hid the trembling Joe in my cabin and
locked him up; it proved a wise action because
Captain Marrow lost no time in boarding us and
asking for an interview with Captain Steele.</p>
<p>This made me nervous, for I knew my father
would not lie under any circumstances, and I
dreaded the result of the ugly Mexican&rsquo;s visit.
So I stood beside my father to make every possible
endeavor to save my protege from recapture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Steele, sir, where&rsquo;s my cabin-boy?&rdquo;
asked Marrow, gruffly, as he came up and touched
his cap.</p>
<p>My father looked him over with grave attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Marrow,&rdquo; he replied, sternly, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s
that calf that broke out&rsquo;n my ten-acre lot three
year ago come next Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marrow muttered a curse and glared at us
evilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happen to know, Steele, that my boy Joe,
who was tryin&rsquo; to vamoose, stole a rotten dinghy
an&rsquo; rowed out to the <i>Seagull</i> the night afore you
sailed. Ain&rsquo;t thet so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe,&rdquo; said my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I demand him in the name o&rsquo; the law,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll hold you here in the bay till you give me
back the stolen goods,&rdquo; continued Marrow,
savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; said my father, turning quietly to his
brawny mate, &ldquo;show Cap&rsquo;n Marrow over the
side, an&rsquo; if he&rsquo;s too slow in goin&rsquo;, toss him overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; returned Ned, pleasantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hev the law, remember! You can&rsquo;t sail
from the harbor till you&rsquo;ve given up my property!&rdquo;
roared the exasperated Mexican.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mebbe,&rdquo; repeated my father, again, as he
turned indifferently away.</p>
<p>But I saw trouble brewing and resolved to head
it off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Marrow,&rdquo; I said, politely, with a motion
to Ned to delay his intention, for the mate&rsquo;s
hand was lifted to seize the fellow in his terrible
grip, &ldquo;please allow me to explain this case.
A boy&mdash;perhaps it was your runaway&mdash;did indeed
board us at Chelsea, as you say; but my
father, Captain Steele, did not discover his presence
until we were at sea. Then we were obliged
to carry him on here, where he was put upon the
dock. I assure you I saw him bolt for the land as
fast as he could go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was true in fact, as I had sent Joe on an
errand. I did not relate, of course, that the boy
had quickly returned, but my tale seemed to impress
Marrow and explain why Captain Steele
had so recklessly sneered at his demands, as if
wilfully defying the marine law. &ldquo;If you make
haste, sir,&rdquo; I continued, very courteously, &ldquo;you
may still be able to lay hands on the boy, who I
am sure has no money to take him any distance
from Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Marrow looked at me shrewdly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Joe say anything about me, or about
money?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word, sir,&rdquo; answering the last question.
&ldquo;But I advise you to make haste. And
you must forgive Captain Steele for his abrupt
answers, caused by what he considered the insolence
of your demand and the knowledge that
you are in the wrong in threatening to hold his
ship. You know, sir, it would cost you heavily
to do this, when the court found you were unable
to prove your case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This argument decided the man. He swore a
nasty oath and stamped his foot in futile rage;
but he at once left the ship to be rowed ashore,
and that was the last we saw of him.</p>
<p>Still I wondered at his interest in the miserable,
half starved boy he had so wickedly abused;
and I wondered at his strange question about
money. There must be some mystery about Joe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock, all being snugly stowed and
the last of our fresh provisions taken aboard, we
hoisted anchor and headed out toward the mouth
of the bay. Our passenger had settled himself in
a spare cabin an hour before, having brought with
him two huge &ldquo;telescopes&rdquo; that appeared to contain
all his belongings.</p>
<p>I did not let Joe out of his confinement until
about midnight, and when from the swish of the
water against our sides I knew we had reached
the open sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">AN OBSTINATE PASSENGER.</span></h2>
<p>It is useless to relate the unimportant incidents
of our voyage to Gibraltar and up the Mediterranean.
The <i>Seagull</i> behaved beautifully in both
good and bad weather, amply fulfilling our most
ardent expectations. It is true the voyage was
unnecessarily long, since with our powerful engines
we could have cut down our time to less
than one-half; but we were obliged to concede
this to Captain Steele&rsquo;s prejudice in favor of
sailing, and the breeze held so steady and persistent
that we cut the waves like a clipper and
made a most remarkable sailing record for the
voyage.</p>
<p>It was not until we passed Sicily that the <i>Seagull</i>
was required to prove her staunchness. The
waves at the lower end of the Mediterranean
were wilder than any I had ever before encountered,
but our beauty rode them like a swan and
never a seam spread nor a beam so much as
creaked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The voyage, however, served to make us better
acquainted with both our boy passenger and my
boy assistant&mdash;the rich man&rsquo;s son and the runaway
Joseph&mdash;though this acquaintance was not
ripened without some interesting experiences.</p>
<p>A more willing or grateful follower no one
could have than Joe Herring. The kindly treatment
accorded him was in such sharp contrast to
the dog&rsquo;s life he had led aboard the <i>Gonzales</i> that
he was anxious to show his appreciation on every
possible occasion. His dark eyes followed me
affectionately wherever I went, and he would
leap quickly to anticipate my every order. Also
he liked to serve Uncle Naboth and my father,
and proved so considerate of their wishes and
comforts that he soon won their hearts completely.
Nor was Joe so frail as he seemed at first
glance. His muscles were hard as iron and on
occasion his thin frame developed remarkable
strength. This he proved conclusively within the
first week of the voyage, as you shall hear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Our young passenger, whose imposing name
we had quickly shortened to plain &ldquo;Archie,&rdquo;
seemed likely to cause us unsuspected trouble.
He at once developed two bad habits. The first
was to sit on deck, lolling in a folding deck chair
he had brought aboard, and play distressing tunes
upon a harmonica&mdash;which he termed a &ldquo;mouth-organ.&rdquo;
The lad must have had a most powerful
inherent love for music to enable him to listen
to his own awful strains; but it was clear his
musical talent was not developed, or at least not
properly educated to any artistic degree.</p>
<p>The first morning out the Captain, forced to
listen to this &ldquo;music,&rdquo; scowled and muttered
under his breath but forbore to interfere with the
passenger&rsquo;s evident enjoyment of his own performance.
The second morning he yelled at
Archie to &ldquo;shut up!&rdquo; but the boy calmly disregarded
the order. The third morning my father
stumped over to where I sat and ordered me to
take away Archie&rsquo;s &ldquo;blamed ol&rsquo; jew&rsquo;s-harp&rdquo; and
fling it overboard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>I had myself been considerably annoyed by the
wretched music, so I obeyed so far as to stroll
over to our passenger and ask him to kindly discontinue
his performance.</p>
<p>He looked up resentfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the passenger&rsquo;s deck, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no passenger&rsquo;s deck; but we allow
you to sit here,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then leave me alone, and mind your own
business,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a free born American
citizen, and I&rsquo;ve paid my passage and can
do as I please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t annoy everybody with that
beastly music while you&rsquo;re aboard the <i>Seagull</i>,&rdquo;
I answered, rather nettled at his attitude. &ldquo;We
also have rights, sir, and they must be considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve paid for mine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You get out,
Sam Steele. I know what I&rsquo;m doing,&rdquo; and he
commenced to play again.</p>
<p>I looked at him reflectively. Just how to
handle such a situation puzzled me. But Joe
stood just behind and had heard all. With a
bound of amazing quickness he was upon the unprepared
Archie, seized the mouth-organ from
his grasp and flung the instrument of torture far
over the side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, sir, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he said, with
a grin.</p>
<p>Archie whistled softly and looked his assailant
over. He rose slowly from his chair and, still
whistling, began to unbutton his coat and take
it off. He folded it neatly, laid it in the chair,
removed his linen cuffs and placed them beside
his coat, and proceeded deliberately to roll up his
sleeves.</p>
<p>The youth&rsquo;s intentions were so obvious that I
was about to order Joe to go below, as his slight
figure seemed no match for the burly Archie,
when a pleading look in the boy&rsquo;s eyes restrained
me.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth and Ned Britton, who had been
promenading the deck near, had noted the incident
and now paused to see its outcome. Some
of the sailors also were interested, from their distant
posts, while my father stood on the bridge
and looked at our little group with an amused
smile lighting his rugged face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Altogether it would not do to retreat in face
of the coming fray, or to interfere with the logical
outcome of Joe&rsquo;s rash act. The Yankee boy&rsquo;s
face was white and set, and his soft whistle only
rendered his bull-headed determination to exact
revenge the more impressive.</p>
<p>Having rolled up his sleeves, doubled his great
fists and swung his arms once or twice to ease his
muscles, Archie advanced steadily upon poor Joe,
who stood listlessly with his hands thrust in his
coat pockets and his head and shoulders bent
slightly forward, in his accustomed pose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That mouth-organ cost two dollars,&rdquo; said
Archie, grimly, &ldquo;and you don&rsquo;t look as if you&rsquo;re
worth two cents. So I&rsquo;ll just take it out o&rsquo; your
hide, my son, to teach you a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he paused and swung his right fist
upward, and Joe, roused to action at last, gave a
sudden bound. My eye could scarcely follow him
as he leapt at Archie, embracing him and clinging
to his antagonist like a vise. To my astonishment,
the bulky Yankee swung around, tottered
and fell heavily upon his back, with Joe kneeling
triumphant upon his breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>We all gave an admiring cheer, for we could
not help it, and at the sound Joe arose and stood
in his place again, meekly as before.</p>
<p>Archie got up more slowly, feeling the back of
his head, which had whacked against the deck.
He made a sudden rush and a lunge with his
fist that might have settled Joe had he not dodged
and closed again on his adversary with the same
lightning tactics he had at first employed. They
fell in a heap, and although Archie tried to keep
Joe hugged to his breast the latter slid away like
an eel and a moment after was on his feet and
had assumed his careless, waiting pose.</p>
<p>When the Yankee got up this time he was
again softly whistling. Without a glance at his
late antagonist he deliberately rolled down his
sleeves, attached his cuffs and resumed his coat.
Then he walked over to Joe and with a smile that
showed more good nature than chagrin he held
out his bulky hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake, sonny,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re good stuff,
and I forgive you everything. Let&rsquo;s be chums,
Joe. If I could have landed on your jaw I&rsquo;d
have mashed you like a turnip; but you wouldn&rsquo;t
let me, and so I&rsquo;m bound to give in gracefully.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>That speech was the best thing the boy had
done, and my original dislike for him began to
evaporate. Joe shook the proffered hand cordially,
and my father, who had come down to
join our group, gave Archie an admiring buffet
on the shoulder and said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do, my lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But after all Joe was the hero of the occasion,
and we all loved him for the clever and skillful
fight he had put up. Archie was an expert boxer,
as we afterward discovered, but Joe&rsquo;s talent for
wrestling gave him a decided advantage in a
rough-and-tumble encounter.</p>
<p>At luncheon we were all in a hearty good
humor, but imagine my dismay to hear shortly
afterward the strains of a mouth-organ coming
from the deck! I ran up at once, and there sat
Master Archie in his chair, blowing furiously
into an instrument fully three inches longer than
the one Joe had tossed overboard.</p>
<p>I laughed; I could not help it; and even my
father&rsquo;s face wore an amused smile. Joe looked
at me inquiringly, but I shook my head and retreated
to my cabin. Such a queer condition of
mutiny deserved careful thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>But, as I said, Archie had another bad habit.
He smoked cigarettes in his stateroom, which was
against our most positive rules. The first time
we observed from the deck thin smoke curling
through the open window of Archie&rsquo;s cabin, a
hasty investigation was made and the cause
speedily discovered. The boy was lying in his
berth, reading a novel and coolly puffing his
cigarette.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth sent for the passenger and
gravely informed him he&rsquo;d have to quit smoking
cigarettes in his cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On deck it don&rsquo;t matter so much,&rdquo; added my
uncle, &ldquo;though a decent pipe is a more manly
smoke, to my notion. But we&rsquo;ve put a furtun&rsquo;
into our new ship, an&rsquo; can&rsquo;t afford to take chances
of burnin&rsquo; her up on the first voyage. Cigarettes
are dangerous. If you throw a lighted stub into
a corner we may go up in smoke and perhaps
lose many vallyble human lives. So we can&rsquo;t allow
it, young man. Smoke yer paper cigars on
deck, ef ye want to; but don&rsquo;t light another in
yer cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Archie made no promise. He listened to my
uncle&rsquo;s lecture, and walked away without a word.</p>
<p>An hour later I saw smoke coming through the
window again, and peering through the aperture
discovered Archie lying in his bunk, calmly
smoking. The boy was exasperatingly stubborn.
I called black Nux and gave him an order. With
a pleased grin the South Sea Islander brought a
length of fire hose, attached it to a plug in the
sruppers and carried the nozzle to Archie&rsquo;s window.
Presently we heard a yell as the powerful
stream struck the smoker and completely deluged
him. He leapt from his berth, only to be struck
full in the face by the water from the hose, which
sent him reeling against the door. I shut off the
water, and Nux, kneeling at the low window,
looked down on the discomfitted Archie and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness sake, Mars Ackley! were dat on&rsquo;y
you-uns? Thought it were a fire, sure thing.
Beg pard&rsquo;n, Mars Ackley!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>After the boy changed his drenched clothing
for dry he came on deck and stalked around in
silent anger while Nux went to the cabin and
cleared it of the water and wet bedding. I wondered
if the lesson would be effective, but could
not judge a nature that was so unlike any I had
ever before encountered.</p>
<p>Bye-and-bye Archie calmed down sufficiently
to drop into his deck chair and begin playing his
mouth-organ. He wailed out the most distressing
attempts at tunes for an entire hour, eyeing defiantly
any who chanced to look toward him; but
we took care not to pay the slightest attention
to his impertinence. Joe came to me once with
a pleading look in his eye, but I shook my head
sternly. The sailors were evidently amused by
our little comedy forward, for I could see them
exchanging smiles now and then when a screech
more blood-curdling than usual came from the
mouth-organ.</p>
<p>Archie tired himself out in time and went below.
He closed and locked his window and began
again to smoke in his cabin. In half an hour
the smoke was so thick in the little room that we
could see nothing but its gray clouds through the
thick pane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The set frown upon my father&rsquo;s face told me
trouble was brewing for our passenger, but as yet
the Captain forbore to interfere. Uncle Naboth
came to me indignant and angry and demanded
to know what should be done to the &ldquo;young pig&rdquo;
whose actions were so insolent and annoying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think,&rdquo; I replied, gravely. &ldquo;We must
certainly conquer young Ackley in some way,
even if we have to toss him overboard; but I
hope it will not come to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then think quick an&rsquo; to the point, Sam,&rdquo; rejoined
my uncle; &ldquo;for I&rsquo;m jest achin&rsquo; to wollop
the fool wi&rsquo; a cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dinner Archie joined our table, silent but
with a sneering and triumphant look upon his
face. He was not handsome at any time, but just
now his damaged face was positively disagreeable
to behold. It occurred to me that the trouble
with the young fellow was that he had not been
taught to obey, and doubtless he imagined we
were his enemies because we were endeavoring to
prevent him from doing exactly what he wanted
to. His idea of being a &ldquo;free-born American
citizen&rdquo; was to be able to override the rights and
privileges of others, and the sooner he got that
notion out of his head the better it would be for
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Archie was a deliberate eater and remained at
the table with a sort of bravado because we took
not the slightest notice of him. So I left him
finishing his meal when I went on deck.</p>
<p>A few minutes afterward, however, he came
bounding up the companionway with a white face
and rushed up to where Uncle Naboth and I were
standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been robbed!&rdquo; he cried, shaking his big
fist at me. &ldquo;My cabin&rsquo;s been entered by a thief,
and I&rsquo;ll have the law on you all if you don&rsquo;t restore
my property!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you lost?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well enough, Sam Steele. I&rsquo;ve lost
all my cigarettes&mdash;ev&rsquo;ry box of &rsquo;em!&mdash;and my
four mouth-organs, too. They picked the lock
on my door, and opened my telescopes, and stole
my property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this, Sam?&rdquo; inquired Uncle Naboth,
his eyes twinkling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rdquo; I answered, greatly surprised.
&ldquo;There are no duplicate keys to the cabin
doors, and Ackley had his in his pocket, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They picked the lock, I tell you, and the locks
on both my traveling cases,&rdquo; declared the boy, in
a rage; &ldquo;and you must be a fine bunch of practiced
thieves, because they were all locked again
after the goods were stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about your window?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left it bolted on the inside. No one could
enter that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you lose anything except the cigarettes
and the mouth-organs?&rdquo; I continued, beginning
to be greatly amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but those things are my property, and
you or your people have stolen them. Look here,
Sam Steele,&rdquo; he added, coming close and shaking
his fist threateningly; &ldquo;either you return my
property in double quick time or I&rsquo;ll take it out
of your hide. Just make your choice, for I mean
business.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>I think he saw that I was not afraid of him, but
I chose to ignore his challenge. I was neither as
clever a wrestler as Joe Herring nor as expert
with my fists as Archie Ackley; so it would be
folly for me to undertake a personal encounter.
But I said, quietly enough:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are getting insolent, my lad, and insolence
I will not stand for. Unless you control
your temper I will order you to the ship&rsquo;s lockup,
and there you shall stay until we drop anchor
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gazed into my face long and steadily, and
then began to whistle softly as he turned and
walked away. But a few moments later he returned
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to make good my loss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send me your bill,&rdquo; replied Uncle Naboth.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Joe stole the things,&rdquo; continued
Archie.</p>
<p>I called Joe to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you enter Ackley&rsquo;s cabin and take his cigarettes
and mouth-organs?&rdquo; Uncle Naboth inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Joe, looking at Archie and laughing
at his angry expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who did it?&rdquo; persisted my
Uncle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Joe, again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying!&rdquo; cried Archie, indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you lying, Joe?&rdquo; I asked, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; returned Joe, touching his cap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell the truth,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t, sir,&rdquo; replied the boy, firmly. &ldquo;If you
question me, I&rsquo;m bound to lie; so it will be better
to let me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This answer surprised and annoyed me, but
Uncle Naboth laughed aloud, and to my astonishment
Archie frankly joined him, without a trace
of his recent ill-nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as I thought,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
slick one, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to do my duty,&rdquo; answered Joe, modestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring me your bill, young feller,&rdquo; said Uncle
Naboth, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll cash it in a jiffy&mdash;an&rsquo; with joy,
too. I don&rsquo;t see jest how Joe managed the affair,
but he&rsquo;s saved us all a lot of trouble, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m much
obleeged to him, fer my part.&rdquo; And the old
gentleman walked away with a cheerful nod.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; I said to Archie. &ldquo;You
wouldn&rsquo;t be reasonable, you know, and we were
simply obliged to maintain our ship&rsquo;s discipline.
So, if your offending goods hadn&rsquo;t been abstracted
so cleverly, there would have been open
war by another day and our side was the
strongest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archie nodded forgivingly toward Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was best,&rdquo; he admitted, with more
generosity than I had expected from him. &ldquo;You
see, Steele, I won&rsquo;t be bulldozed or browbeaten
by a lot of cheap skates who happen to own a
ship, for I&rsquo;m an independent American citizen.
So I had to hold out as long as I could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were wrong in that,&rdquo; I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right or wrong, I&rsquo;ll hold my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bad philosophy, Archie. When you
took passage aboard this ship you made yourself
subject to our rules and regulations, and in all
honesty you&rsquo;re bound to abide by them. A true
American shows his independence best by upholding
the laws of his country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rot,&rdquo; growled Archie, but Joe and I
both laughed at him because he could find nothing
better to say. When he returned to his deck
chair the passenger&rsquo;s face bore its normal expression
of placid good nature. It was evident he
prided himself on the fact that he had not &ldquo;given
in&rdquo; of his own accord, and perhaps he was glad
that the force of circumstances alone had conquered
his stubborn temper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A RIOT AND A RESCUE.</span></h2>
<p>After that we had little trouble with Archie
Ackley, although in many ways the stubborn nature
of the boy was unpleasantly evident. In his
better moods he was an agreeable companion, but
neither Joe nor I, the only two other boys aboard,
sought his society more than was necessary. My
uncle and the Captain both declared there was a
heap of good in the lad, and a few such lessons
as the one he had received would make a man
of him.</p>
<p>Joe I found a treasure in many ways, and always
a faithful friend. Since that first night
when he had come aboard he had nothing to tell
of his past history or experiences; but his nature
was quick and observant and I could see he had
picked up somewhere a considerable fund of
worldly knowledge which he could draw upon as
occasion offered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>My father, Uncle Naboth, and I were all three
delighted with the <i>Seagull&rsquo;s</i> sailing performances,
though secretly I longed to discover how
she would behave under steam, since her propeller
had never been in use since the day it was given
a brief trial test in Chelsea Bay. Tomlinson, the
engineer, assured me we could make from sixteen
to eighteen knots when the engines were
working, and the man was naturally as impatient
as I was to test their full powers. Still, we realized
that we must wait, and Captain Steele was
so delighted with the superb sailing qualities of
the ship that even I had not the heart to suggest
supplanting his white wings with black smoke
from our funnels.</p>
<p>In due time we crossed the stormy Mediterranean
and reached in safety our Syrian port,
where we unloaded the rugs and delivered them
in good condition to the consignees. We sailed
along the coast, past Port Said, and finally came
to the Bay of Alexandria, where we were to unload
Ackley&rsquo;s cases of &ldquo;modern antiques&rdquo; and get
rid of our passenger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>It was a new experience to me to find myself on
the historic shores of Egypt, anchored before the
famous city founded by Alexander the Great. I
begged Uncle Naboth to take me ashore; overhearing
my request Archie Ackley invited us all&mdash;with
an air of great condescension&mdash;to dine
with him at the Royal Khedivial Hotel.</p>
<p>My father refused. He was too fond of the
<i>Seagull</i> to leave her alone in a foreign port; but
Ned Britton took his place, and the four of us&mdash;Archie,
Uncle Naboth, the Mate and I&mdash;followed
by our faithful blacks, Nux and Bryonia, disembarked
on the quay and walked up the long,
foreign-looking streets to the big hotel.</p>
<p>It was a queer sensation to find ourselves moving
amidst a throng of long-robed turbaned
Arabs; fez-topped Turks, with Frenchmen, and
Syrians; gray-bearded, stooping Jews; blind beggars;
red-coated English soldiers, and shrinking,
veiled Moslem women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a mess of foreigners,&rdquo; cried Archie,
and Uncle Naboth, with a laugh, reminded him
that we were the foreigners and this curiously
mixed crowd, the natives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>We dined in sumptuous style at the handsome
hotel, for Archie proved a liberal host and feasted
us royally. It was late at night when we retraced
our steps toward the quay; but the streets
of the city were still thronged with people, many
of whom were sitting at little tables placed on
the sidewalks, where they smoked and drank
Turkish coffee and chatted together in a very
babel of tongues.</p>
<p>As we left the heart of Alexandria and drew
near to the water-front the streets became more
deserted and the lights were fewer and dimmer.
There were still straggling groups here and there,
and suddenly, as we turned a corner, we observed
a commotion just ahead of us and heard a terrified
voice cry out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help&mdash;Americans&mdash;help!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Ned Britton gave a bound and was in the thick
of the mel&eacute;e at once. Archie was only a step
behind him and I saw his big fists swinging right
and left in fast and furious fashion, while Joe
ducked his head and tossed a tall Arab over his
shoulder with marvelous ease. Nux and Bryonia
took a hand, and while none of our party was
armed, the free use of their terrible fists wrought
such havoc among the long-gowned Arabs that
the result of the skirmish was not long in doubt.
Like a mist they faded away and escaped into
the night, leaving a little man wriggling and
moaning upon the ground as if in deathly agony.
I held fast to my left arm, which had been
slashed by a knife and was bleeding profusely,
while I stared around in surprise at our easy victory.
Uncle Naboth had not taken part in the
fray, but now appeared seated calmly upon the
prostrate form of the Arab whom Joe had vanquished,
and his two hundred and odd pounds
rendered the prisoner fairly secure.</p>
<p>Our blacks raised the little man to his feet,
where he ceased squirming but stood weakly leaning
against Nux and trembling like a leaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, sir?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>
<p>The stranger shook his head. It was so dark in
this spot that we could not distinguish his
features very clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think not,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;But they nearly
had me, that time. If you hadn&rsquo;t come up as you
did, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>He broke off abruptly and leaned over to peer
at the Arab Uncle Naboth was sitting upon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him! That&rsquo;s Abdul Hashim himself!
Kill him&mdash;kill him quick, some one!&rdquo; he yelled, in
a sudden frenzy.</p>
<p>The cry seemed to rouse the Arab to life. Like
an eel he twisted, and Uncle Naboth slid off his
back and bumped upon the sidewalk. The next
moment we Americans were alone, for Abdul
Hashim had saved his bacon by vanishing instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, why&mdash;<i>why</i> did you let him go?&rdquo; wailed
the little man, covering his face with his hands.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get me again, some day&mdash;he&rsquo;s sure to get
me again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said Ned, gruffly, for we
were all disgusted at this exhibition of the fellow&rsquo;s
unmanly weakness. &ldquo;You can thank God
you&rsquo;re out of his clutches this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, sir&mdash;I do, indeed!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t leave me just now, I beg of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>We looked at Uncle Naboth for advice. Bry
had slit my sleeve with his pocketknife and was
binding a handkerchief tightly around my wound,
for he was something of a surgeon as well as a
cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going aboard our ship,&rdquo; said my uncle,
shortly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to come along, my
man, an&rsquo; stay till mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger accepted the invitation with alacrity
and we started again for the quay, which was
reached without farther incident. Our boat was
waiting and we were soon rowed where the <i>Seagull</i>
was anchored and climbed aboard.</p>
<p>Under the clear light of the cabin lamp we
looked at the person we had rescued with natural
curiosity, to find a slender man, with stooping
shoulders, a red Van Dyke beard, bald head and
small eyes covered with big spectacles. He was
about forty years of age, wore European clothes
somewhat threadbare and faded in color, and his
general appearance was one of seedy respectability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, sitting in an easy chair
and facing the attentive group before him, &ldquo;I am
Professor Peter Pericles Van Dorn, of the University
of Milwaukee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>I had never heard of such a university; but
then, Milwaukee is a good way inland. Neither
had any of us before heard the name so
unctuously announced; though we were too polite
to say so, and merely nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will please me,&rdquo; continued the Professor,
&ldquo;to be informed of your station and the business
that has brought you to Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle laughed and looked at me quizzically,
as if inviting me to satisfy the stranger. Captain
Steele scowled, resenting the implied impertinence.
The only others present were Archie and
Ned Britton.</p>
<p>I told Van Dorn we were a merchant ship from
Boston, and had casually touched at the port of
Alexandria to unload some wares belonging to
Mr. Ackley, who was going to ship his property to
Luxor and deliver it to merchants there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of wares?&rdquo; demanded the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarabs, funeral figures, and copies of antique
jewelry,&rdquo; replied Archie, a bit uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The curse of the country,&rdquo; snapped the little
man, scornfully. &ldquo;There ought to be a law to
prevent such rubbish being shipped into Egypt&mdash;except,&rdquo;
pausing to continue with a touch of bitterness,
&ldquo;that there are too many laws in this
beastly country already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;The poor tourists must have scarabs to take
home with them,&rdquo; said Archie, with a grin.
&ldquo;About fifteen thousand travelers come to Egypt
every year, and your Khedive won&rsquo;t let any genuine
scarabs leave Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call him <i>my</i> Khedive, sir!&rdquo; cried the
little professor. &ldquo;I detest&mdash;I <i>hate</i> the government
here, and everything connected with it.
But you are not interested in that. Gentlemen,&rdquo;
assuming a pompous tone, &ldquo;I am glad to meet
you. You have arrived in the very nick of time
to save me from assassination, or at least from
utter failure in my great work. I am sure it was
an All-wise Providence that directed you to stop
at Alexandria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disguised as old Ackley&rsquo;s mud scarabs,&rdquo;
added my uncle, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are your future plans?&rdquo; inquired
the Professor, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To return to America at once,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! A thousand times no!&rdquo; shouted little
Van Dorn, banging his fist on the table, &ldquo;I charter
you from this minute. I engage this ship&mdash;at
your own price&mdash;to transport me and my
treasure to New York!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasure!&rdquo; we exclaimed, incredulously.</p>
<p>The Professor glanced around and lowered
his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest treasure, gentlemen, that has
ever been discovered in Egypt. I have found the
place where the priests of Karnak and Luxor hid
their vast wealth at the invasion of Cambyses
the Persian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused impressively. My father looked
at his watch and Uncle Naboth yawned. For
myself, I should have liked to hear more, but my
wound was paining me and Bry awaited my
coming to dress it properly. So I said to our
guest:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, Professor, we will hear your
story in the morning. It is now late, and we are
all longing for our berths. So we will bid you
good-night and wish you pleasant dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glared at me indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you sleep after what I have told you?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so, sir,&rdquo; I replied, and turned away to
call Joe to show the man to his room. He made
no farther protest, but going away and looking
rather thoughtful.</p>
<p>Bry found that the knife had merely inflicted a
flesh wound on my arm, and promised it would
give me little trouble. The bleeding had stopped,
so my black surgeon washed the cut thoroughly,
bandaged and plastered it quite professionally,
and sent me to bed to sleep soundly until morning.</p>
<p>Really, I forgot all about the Professor, who
looked the part of a savant much better than he
acted it, it seemed to me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE PROFESSOR&rsquo;S SECRET.</span></h2>
<p>At breakfast Professor Van Dorn was silent
and pre&ouml;ccupied, and as soon as the meal was
over asked for a private interview with the person
in authority aboard the <i>Seagull</i>. We went
to the Captain&rsquo;s room, a large cabin where all
could be comfortably seated. None of us had
much confidence in the stranger&rsquo;s romantic assertions
of the night before, but we were all curious
to know what tale the man had to relate, and
were disposed to listen. Archie&rsquo;s eyes bunged
out so far from his round face that I took pity on
the boy and asked him to join us. Ned Britton
came, too, for he had been present at Van Dorn&rsquo;s
rescue and we trusted him implicitly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>When we were seated and the Professor had
assured himself we could not be overheard, he
at once asked permission to relate the business
that had brought him to Egypt and the strange
experiences he had encountered here. We told
him to fire away and we would hear his story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you must know that I
hold the honorable chair of Egyptology in my
university. Since my youth I have studied arduously
the history of this most ancient people,
from whom sprung the modern civilization of
which we boast today.&rdquo; He spoke pedantically,
and I began to think he might be a real professor,
after all. &ldquo;To perfect my studies my college
generously sent me here, three years ago, and
soon after my arrival I became acquainted with
Professor John Lovelace, whose famous works
on ancient Egypt you have doubtless read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had not read them, but we let the assertion
pass.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Over here,&rdquo; continued the narrator, &ldquo;he was
usually called Lovelace Pasha, but he was not
entitled to the distinction except in the imagination
of the natives, who had a high respect for
his intelligence and industry. At the time we
met Lovelace he was searching diligently but
secretly for a vast treasure, and he took me into
his confidence and engaged me to assist him.
You must know that in the sixth century before
Christ Egypt was at its height of wealth and
greatness; and the most important treasures were
at that time in the possession of the priests of
the great temple of Karnak. They consisted of
wonderful gems, countless jewels and ornaments
of gold and silver and, above all, a library of
papyrus rolls relating the history of Egypt during
that now unknown period between the sixth
and twelfth dynasties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At this time, when the Egyptians had grown
as proud and insolent as they were wealthy, that
terrible Persian, Cambyses, invaded the country
with a conquering host and steadily advanced
up the Nile toward Karnak and Thebes, laying
waste the country as he came and despoiling the
temples of their wealth. The legends say that
the priests of Karnak, terror stricken, threw all
their treasure into the Sacred Lake which adjoins
their temple, in order to keep it from falling into
the hands of the invader; and, as the lake is bottomless,
the treasure has never yet been recovered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sirs, Professor Lovelace, a shrewd and
far-seeing man, doubted the truth of this story.
It was an undeniable fact that the great treasure
of Karnak was hidden somewhere by the priests,
and that Cambyses put all the holy men to the
sword because they would not reveal their secret.
Also it is historical that the treasure has not since
been discovered, and that the conqueror was unable
to lay hands upon it after all his efforts to
do so. During the centuries that have passed the
Sacred Lake has been dragged many times, with
the hope of finding the immense wealth of Karnak;
but it is now known that the quicksands at
the bottom of the lake would have swallowed it
up instantly, so naturally all these attempts have
proved absolute failures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;My friend Lovelace, pondering on this queer
story, came to believe that the wily priests had
never thrown their treasure into the lake at all.
No one knew better than they that to place it
there was to lose it forever; furthermore, the
most valuable part of the treasure consisted of
the historic papyri&mdash;the bark rolls on which the
ancient Egyptians inscribed their records. To
place these in water would be to destroy them;
thus the falsity of the tale was evident. It was
clear, my friend decided, that the priests had
hidden the treasure somewhere in the desert, near
Karnak, where the shifting sands would leave no
evidence of the place to betray it to the keen eyes
of the Persian. But they spread the report that
it had been cast into the lake, so if any traitor
might be among the people the truth would not
be revealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since Cambyses put every priest of Karnak
to death, in his unreasoning anger, there was
none to recover the treasure when the Persian
was gone home again, from which Professor
Lovelace conjectured that it still lay secure in its
original hiding-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where was that hiding place? That was
the question to be solved. For years he sought in
the desert without success but with rare patience,
and at just about the time I arrived in Egypt he
obtained a clue to guide him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;On one of the ruined temple walls, hidden
away in an unimportant corner, is carved a diagram
which to an ordinary observer appeared to
mean nothing at all. But Lovelace studied it
and came to the conclusion that the diagram described
the spot where the treasure was hidden.
There was a picture of a high arch, called in
Egypt a pylon; and through this picture, from
one corner diagonally across to another corner,
a line was chiseled. This line extended far beyond
the pylon, past a group of three pictured
palm trees, and then ended in a cross. Do you
follow me, gentlemen?&rdquo; with an eager, nervous
glance into our faces.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth nodded, but he looked bewildered.
Archie&rsquo;s face wore a perfectly blank expression.
My father was smoking placidly and
looking out of the cabin window. Said I:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not very familiar with Egyptian history,
Professor; but I think we catch the drift
of your story. Pay out the cable, sir, and we&rsquo;ll
grasp what we can of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed relieved, saying:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my boy. Egyptian history is very
fascinating, but this is neither the time nor the
place for me to instruct you in it. Still, it is
necessary that you understand something of the
importance of the proposition I am going to
make you, and I will be as clear as possible in my
descriptions. The arch, or pylon, referred to
in the picture, had three square towers, to distinguish
it from many others, and after searching
long among the ruins of Karnak, which cover
many acres, Lovelace Pasha and I found one
which, though partly demolished, still had one
of the characteristic towers left, with traces of
the others. Taking these as our guide we drew
an imaginary line from corner to corner, as in
the diagram, and taking our compass we started
out to follow this imaginary line across the
desert. Three miles away we found, to our great
joy, the group of palms, very ancient, without
doubt, but still standing, and near to these was
a small oasis watered by a tiny spring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;The question now remaining was, how far
beyond the three palms was the point marked on
the diagram by the cross&mdash;the point where the
treasure had been buried? We were obliged to
work very cautiously, for at this oasis lived a
small but fierce tribe of desert Arabs having for
their sheik, or ruler, one Abdul Hashim&mdash;the
same devil who nearly murdered me last night.
The Arabs were curious to know what we were
after, for they are great thieves and often steal
the contents of an ancient tomb after some lucky
excavator has discovered it. So we kept our
secret from them, until finally they became so
angry that they would have driven us away from
their neighborhood had not Professor Lovelace
secured an order from the Khedive granting him
the privilege of excavating and exploring in certain
sections of the desert for relics of Egypt&rsquo;s
ancient civilization. The Khedive will always
grant these licenses, permitting the explorer to
work at his own expense in the interests of science;
but when a discovery has been made the
laws oblige us to give or sell everything to the
National Museum at Cairo, where they pay only
the most insignificant prices because there is no
other legal way in which one may dispose of
ancient treasure or relics.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that absurd law did not concern us at
the time; what we were eager for was to discover
the hidden treasure of Karnak, and to avoid the
hostile Arabs we worked mostly during the clear
moonlit nights, when all the tribe were asleep.
We had sand-augers made, with which we
burrowed into the sand to the foundation of rock
underneath, striving to find some obstruction to
indicate where the treasure was buried. By
means of our compass we were enabled to follow a
straight line, and we worked slowly and carefully
for a distance of five miles beyond the oasis, and
then back again, without any definite result.
Sometimes we would strike an obstruction and
dig down only to find a point of rock or a loose
boulder, and the task seemed to me, after a few
months, to be endless and impracticable. But
Lovelace would not give up. He was positive he
was on the right track, and when I declared I
had had enough of the job and was going back
to Cairo, he became suspicious of me, and threatened
to kill me if I deserted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was my first suspicion that his mind had
become unbalanced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You know too much, Van Dorn, to be
permitted to go away and blab my secrets to
others,&rsquo; he said. I assured him I should keep a
closed mouth, but the fellow was so crazy over
his idea that he would not trust me. He was a
big man, determined and masterful, and I had to
obey him whether I wanted to or not. I stuck
to the search, though I became afraid of my
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sirs, not to bother you with details
which are to you unimportant, I will say that
finally, after more than two years of patient
search, we chanced upon the treasure. My auger
one day stuck in the sand and could not be
withdrawn. Digging down we found that the
point had plunged into a bronze ring and become
fast. Lovelace gave a howl of joy at sight of
the ring, for he knew then that our search was
ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was after midnight, with bright stars
shining down to light us as we worked. We
cleared away the sand to the depth of more than
four feet, and found the ring, duly attached to
a large block of granite that rested on the rock
foundation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a layer of rock under the desert
sands, then?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; in this section of the country,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;Archeologists will tell you that originally
the earth was covered by a vast table-land of
solid rock such as we now call sandstone. The
erosion of wind and weather caused bits of this
rock to crumble. The simoons caught them and
whirled them around, breaking off other particles
of rock and crumbling them into sand. As ages
passed the sand increased in volume, until now
the desert is covered with it to a depth of from
two to six feet, and sometimes even more. Often
the winds blow this sand into billows, leaving the
bare table-land of rock to be seen stretching for
miles and miles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to return to my story. The block of
granite was heavy, measuring three by six feet
on the surface and being more than two feet in
thickness. Three bronze rings were imbedded
in it, but pry and lift as we would we could not
budge the huge stone an inch. It was evident
that we must have help, so we covered up the
stone again, marked the spot carefully, and went
back to the Arab village.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning Lovelace bargained with the
sheik, Abdul Hashim, for the use of two of his
men to assist us. Also we were obliged to send
to Luxor for four stout staves to use as levers.
You may well imagine that all this excited the
wonder of the Arabs, and I doubted if Lovelace
would be able to keep his secret from them.
However, he appeared to attach no importance
to this danger, and the next evening we set out
for our buried stone, accompanied by our assistants
bearing the oaken staves. We quickly dug
away the sand and cleared the stone, and then
we four used the levers together and by straining
our muscles to the utmost managed to lift the
huge slab of granite until it stood on edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Underneath was a rock cavity, carefully
chiseled out by hand, and at first we saw only a
mass of dried reeds brought from the Nile bank.
Removing these we came upon heavy layers of
rotted cloth, of the kind that was once used in
Egypt for wrapping mummies. But after this
padding was dragged away the treasure became
visible and Lovelace&rsquo;s hands shook with excitement
while he examined it. First there were
many rolls of papyrus, carefully swathed in
bandages; then several Canopic jars of pure gold,
each containing quarts of wonderful pearls,
rubies and emeralds; and finally a vast collection
of wrought jewelry, gold and silver ornaments,
some packed in rude wooden boxes which were
old and falling to decay and others scattered
loosely over them and filling every crevice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lovelace said not a word while we were examining
this vast treasure, the most remarkable
collection that has come down to us from
antiquity. His face was white and set and
except for the trembling of his hands he kept
himself under perfect control. The eyes of the
Arabs, however, glittered with cupidity, and I
caught them exchanging significant glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor took a couple of handfuls of
rubies and pearls and thrust them carelessly into
his pockets. He selected a few golden ornaments
of exquisite workmanship, and replaced all the
rest of the treasure, with its padding, in the rock
cavity. When this had been done he commanded
us to replace the granite slab, which we did,
tipping it forward so that it again covered the
orifice. Our next task was to fill in the sand, and
as a light breeze was blowing we knew that in an
hour the desert would show no marks of the
excavation we had so recently made. The levers
we left lying beside the granite slab, buried deep
in the sand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lovelace now motioned the Arabs to return
toward their village, and they set out eagerly
enough, we following close behind them. But
after we had proceeded a few hundred yards
Lovelace Pasha drew his revolver and calmly shot
both men dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, Van Dorn,&rsquo; he said to me, &lsquo;help me to
bury this carrion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horrified as I was at the murderous act I
hastened to obey, for there was something strange
about the Professor that night&mdash;a steely, cruel
gleam in his usually kindly eyes&mdash;that recalled my
former suspicions and made me fear that his
great discovery had actually driven him mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silently we dug away the sand where the men
had fallen and covered them up, smoothing the
surface afterward as well as we were able. We
proceeded to the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where are my children?&rsquo; demanded the
sheik, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gone away on a far errand,&rsquo; said Lovelace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was true enough, but Abdul Hashim was
dissatisfied and suspicious. We slept late the next
morning, and meantime the sheik had sent spies
upon our trail. The jackals had dug up the bodies
of the murdered Arabs and had half devoured
them when their comrades reached the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was open war between the tribe and us.
We occupied a small stone house at the edge of
the village. It had but one door and no windows,
being merely a bare room thatched with palm
leaves. When we heard the tribe running toward
us with wild cries we knew the climax had
arrived. Lovelace stood in the doorway and kept
the Arabs at bay with his revolvers, but he did not
know how long he would be able to hold out. He
gave me the gems and gold ornaments and told
me to escape and make my way to Luxor for help.
I was instructed to put the treasure into the bank,
gather a rescue party, and return as speedily as
possible. Luxor was distant only four miles
across the desert.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;While the Arabs were watching in front of
the house I stood on the Professor&rsquo;s shoulders,
broke through the thatch at the rear, and dropped
from the top of the stone wall to the sands beneath.
While he returned to the entrance to
distract their attention by a shot, I darted away
toward Luxor and was soon safe from pursuit,
even had I chanced to be observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I performed my errand quickly and returned
with a detachment of mounted police lent me by
the governor of the city, for Professor Lovelace
was a well-known explorer and under the protection
of the Khedive. We arrived too late. I
found only the Professor&rsquo;s dead body, terribly
mutilated by the knives of the Arabs. They had
tricked him in some way during my absence, and
so obtained their revenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abdul Hashim calmly told the officers that
Lovelace Pasha had gone mad, and was slain by
them in self-defense. He pointed to two dead
men and several wounded to prove the truth of
his assertion. I told another story, as you may
imagine, but with no hint of the treasure. Shortly
afterward I had the satisfaction of inducing the
governor to raze Abdul Hashim&rsquo;s village to the
ground, so that not one of the rude stones
remained upon another, while the tribe was driven
farther into the desert to seek new quarters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately I had not banked the sample
treasure we had taken, not wishing to delay my
friend&rsquo;s rescue, so that now I found myself the
sole possessor of any knowledge relating to the
great discovery. It has remained my personal
secret until this hour, when I have confided it to
you, gentlemen, in order to induce you to
assist me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, as if the tale was ended, and for
a time we, his listeners, remained silent and
thoughtful. The story had impressed me, for
one, greatly, and it had seemed to ring true until
he came to that row with the Arabs. There were
some unlikely statements about the death of Lovelace
and Van Dorn&rsquo;s peculiar escape from the
village, but I reflected that my ignorance of the
ways of this people might well account for any
seeming improbabilities that lurked in the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TREASURE OF THE ANCIENTS.</span></h2>
<p>Uncle Naboth was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;why you have selected
us to receive your confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had two reasons,&rdquo; replied Van Dorn. &ldquo;One
is that I am afraid. I left Luxor and traveled
to Cairo, trying to think of a way to secure the
treasure for myself. At Cairo I was shot at from
a window and narrowly escaped death. I came
on here to Alexandria, as secretly as I could. Last
night I was set upon by a band of Arabs, among
whom I recognized the terrible Abdul Hashim.
Had you not appeared at the same instant I would
certainly have been killed. It seems as if Providence
had decreed that we should meet. You
have a swift vessel, bound for America, and I
have a great treasure to be secured and transported
home. Assist me in this emergency and
your reward shall be greater than you could gain
from a dozen voyages.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;This treasure,&rdquo; said my father, slowly and
reflectively, &ldquo;belongs to the Egyptian government,
accordin&rsquo; to your own say-so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; cried Van Dorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it that way, from your statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said the present laws of Egypt, enacted a
few years ago, forbade any relic of the old
civilization to be taken out of the country. The
Museum will buy all my treasure, and give me an
insignificant sum not at all commensurate with its
value; but what right has the Khedive to claim
what I have worked so hard to secure? In
America the gems alone will sell for millions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is an Egyptian treasure,&rdquo; I said.
&ldquo;The laws seem to me to be just. What right
have you, a foreigner, to remove this great wealth
from the country?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>&ldquo;The right of discovery,&rdquo; retorted the little
Professor, promptly, with an energetic bob of his
head. &ldquo;Who is the Khedive of Egypt? A Turk.
A foreigner like myself, if you please, who rules
here as a dependant of Turkey, and pays the
Sultan eleven millions a year in tribute&mdash;a sum
he wrings from the remnant of the true Egyptians,
and from the Arab and other native population,
by means of excessive taxes. This treasure
once belonged to Egypt, we will admit, and it was
buried by the Egyptian priests to save it from
just such invaders as these Turks. But Egyptians
no longer rule Egypt, nor ever will again; so that
in simple justice this treasure belongs solely to its
discoverer rather than to the usurper in the land
where it lies buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Uncle Naboth, &ldquo;we have this government
to reckon with. Morally, you may be
entitled to the treasure, but legally the decrees of
the Khedive are inviolable. Eh? If we attempt
to run away with this &rsquo;ere treasure, an&rsquo; get caught,
we can be punished as common thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we shall not be caught!&rdquo; cried the Professor.
&ldquo;Mark you, no one in Egypt suspects the
existence of this treasure, so to take it will be
robbing no one&mdash;not even the Khedive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Abdul Hashim suspect it?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; perhaps I should make an exception of
Abdul Hashim; but his information is at present
confined to mere guessing, and he is too wily and
covetous ever to tell his suspicions to a government
official. What he wants is to get the
treasure for himself, and the real battle, if we
meet opposition, will be between Abdul Hashim
and us. We ought to have killed him last night,
when we had the chance; but unfortunately the
dog made his escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a dangerous enemy,&rdquo; observed Ned
Britton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only to the unarmed and helpless,&rdquo; quickly
replied the Professor. &ldquo;A half dozen Americans
could defy his entire tribe. And it is possible we
shall get a chance to kill him before he makes
more trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak of murder very easily,&rdquo; said my
father.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is not murder to kill an Arab,&rdquo; protested
the Professor. &ldquo;They are but heathen men,
wicked and cruel, and so numerous that a few of
them sent to perdition will never be missed. The
English here have no more hesitation in killing
an Arab than in scotching a poisonous snake, and
the authorities seldom inquire into the manner of
his death. As long as the government remains in
ignorance of my secret we are safe from interference,
except through this wild and worthless
tribe led by Abdul Hashim, and brave Americans
have no cause to fear him. Moreover, there is
the treasure itself to be considered. Is it not
worth while to risk something to secure an
immense fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What proof have you,&rdquo; asked Uncle Naboth,
&ldquo;of the existence of this treasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Dorn hesitated a moment, then unbuttoned
his vest and took from around his waist a leathern
belt. This he laid carefully upon the table, and
opening its folds drew out a number of
brilliant rubies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is my proof,&rdquo; said he, offering the gems
for inspection. &ldquo;They are a part of the treasure
Lovelace took on that terrible night I have
described to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We examined them. They were large and
brilliant, but cut into squares and oblongs, triangles
and octagons, with smooth flat surfaces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These may be glass,&rdquo; remarked Uncle Naboth,
musingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am a lapidary,&rdquo; said the Professor, his voice
slightly trembling with indignation. &ldquo;I assure
you they are the most splendid rubies in the
known world. Here are pearls. Even your
ignorance will acknowledge their genuineness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He produced, as he spoke, several superb
pearls, as large as peas and tinted in exquisite
rose colors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Perkins, &ldquo;I know pearls,
all right; for I have traded for years with the
Philippine pearl fishers. You are a strange man,
Professor Van Dorn, to wish to risk your life for
more of this plunder. Here is a fortune in itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Dorn shrugged his stooped shoulders, his
red beard bristling with scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you, then, advise me to allow the
treasure of Karnak to remain another two thousand
years buried in the sands of the desert?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;Are your big speculators in America
satisfied to acquire a million, or do they every one
labor like slaves to make their million into a
billion? Men are satisfied with many things in
this age, but never are they satisfied with wealth.
The more we have the more we strive to obtain.
But here&mdash;look at these ornaments. Can modern
goldsmiths match them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>He drew out a golden necklace of magnificent
workmanship, quaint in design and wrought with
a delicacy and skill that were wonderful. A
bracelet, two rings, and a diadem set with amethysts
were also exhibited to our admiring eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; said the Professor, &ldquo;you must admit
are both antique and valuable; yet they are a
mere sample of the immense treasure I have discovered.
There is enough, as I have told you, to
make us all wealthy, and I am willing to divide
liberally in order to obtain your assistance. But
I shall not urge you. If you are too stupid or
cowardly to accept my offer, keep my secret and
go about your business. No harm is done. There
will be thousands willing to undertake the
adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put the jewels and ornaments back into the
belt and buckled it around his waist, hiding it
again underneath his vest. He leaned back in his
chair, lighted a cigarette, and glanced at our grave
faces inquiringly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be good enough to go on deck for a time,
Professor,&rdquo; said my father. &ldquo;We will talk the
matter over among ourselves before venturing to
give you an answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose without protest and retired, and at
once we began an earnest discussion of the proposal.
The first point to settle was the legality
of the thing, and it seemed to us the Professor
was right in his contention that the present
powers in Egypt, which had acquired the country
by wars of conquest, had no more moral right to
claim the buried treasure of the ancient priests of
Karnak than had its recent discoverers. The
old religion based on the worship of Isis and
Osiris had disappeared from the earth and its
votaries were long since dead or dispersed. The
hidden treasure, formerly the property of this
religious body, had now no legal claimants and
belonged to whomsoever had the fortune to find
it and the courage to seize and hold it. That the
Khedive had made laws forbidding anyone to
remove ancient treasure from Egypt did not
affect us in the least. We were free Americans
and in no way under the dominion of the Turks
who had conquered Egypt. They might exact
tribute from this land and establish the claim of
might to whatever wealth the country contained;
but it was our privilege to evade this might if we
chose to. There are true Egyptians yet living in
Egypt, but they are poor-spirited folk and are
largely outnumbered by the Arabs, Turks and
other foreigners, so that the control of their native
land is doubtless lost to them forever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Having thus satisfied our consciences that we
were justified in undertaking an adventure to
secure this wealth, we faced the consequences of
failure or discovery. There was nothing to
demand our immediate return to America, and
the time required by the undertaking was therefore
available. But the <i>Seagull</i> represented a
fortune to us, and we hesitated to jeopardize her
safety. According to international treaty we were
not safe from seizure in case the ship violated the
laws of Egypt; but there was a strong probability
that the worst fate liable to overtake us, if discovered,
would be the confiscation of the treasure.
The Khedive would hesitate to involve his country
in a dispute with the United States by resorting
to extreme measures. We were taking a chance,
of course; but the game seemed well worth the
chance, and none can expect to win who hesitates
to risk a stake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Having disposed of governmental interference
we faced the question of a war with Abdul
Hashim and his tribe, and decided to contest the
Arab&rsquo;s claim&mdash;which was not in any way equal
to that of the Professor, according to the story
he had told us. We had before this encountered
some desperate adventures in strange lands and
were not disposed to shrink from a skirmish with
these lawless Arabs, if they forced it upon us.
There remained, then, but two points to be
settled: the best way to get the treasure aboard
ship, and our share in the division, once we had
safely transported it to America.</p>
<p>We recalled the Professor and asked him for
his plans and proposals. He was a queer little
fellow, this Van Dorn; half coward and half
bully; but there was no doubt the man possessed
a share of shrewd intelligence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we undertake to go up the Nile, past Cairo
and Assuit,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and try to bring the
treasure back to Alexandria, the chances are that
we should never succeed. This is the most
populous portion of Egypt, and government spies
and the mounted police are everywhere. Had
this been my plan I should not have appealed to
you to assist me. Your claim to become my
allies lies in the fact that you have a swift ship
unknown in these waters, a brave crew, and the
American love for adventure. But the ship is the
most important possession of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect us to sail up the Nile, do
you?&rdquo; I asked, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that is impossible,&rdquo; was his quiet reply.
&ldquo;From here to Luxor is seven hundred miles; but
the Arabian Gulf, in the Red Sea, is only ninety
miles from where the treasure is hidden. You
will take your ship to Port Said, through the
Suez Canal, and so down the Gulf to the small
and unimportant town of Koser, where there is
a good harbor. Here we shall hire camels which
will take us in four days across the Arabian desert
to the treasure, which we shall load upon the
camels and bring back with us to the ship. We
shall not appear at Karnak or Luxor at all, you
see, and shall encounter only the desert Bedouins,
who are quite friendly to Europeans. Nor need
we even approach the ruins of Abdul Hashim&rsquo;s
village. I know how to find the spot where the
treasure lies, and in that lonely place there will
be none to spy upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;But how shall we find our way across the
desert?&rdquo; asked Uncle Naboth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there still exists an ancient caravan
route from Koser to Luxor,&rdquo; the Professor
returned, &ldquo;and we shall be able to secure guides
who know every step of the way. It will be a
tedious journey; four days to go and four to
return; but, as I have said, the reward will be
ample for such insignificant hardships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your plan seems safe and practical,&rdquo; observed
my uncle. &ldquo;I like the idea. But now, Van Dorn,
we must come to the most important point of all.
What do you offer us in return for the use of our
ship, for our services and for the expenses of the
undertaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you ten rubies and ten pearls,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;They are of such size and purity that
you can easily sell them for ten thousand dollars.
That is an ample reward, it seems to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>I laughed, and the others&mdash;even to Archie&mdash;smiled
as if amused. The little Professor had
spoken with an air of great condescension, as if
conferring upon us a rare favor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much treasure is there?&rdquo; asked my
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will not matter to you,&rdquo; retorted Van
Dorn. &ldquo;I will give you the pearls and the rubies
now, before we start. They shall be your wage.
Afterward, all the treasure we secure shall be my
own exclusive property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth yawned&mdash;it was a habit he had
when bored&mdash;and my father slowly arose and
stumped from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you go ashore, Professor?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that question?&rdquo; he
demanded, his face nearly as red as his beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that we intend to sail on our return
voyage at sundown, and probably you are not
quite ready to go to America in our company.
One of the boats will land you on the quay
whenever you please to go.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>He looked at me intently, his face now turned
chalky white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Archie,&rdquo; said I, cheerily, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go and
see about unloading your boxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; cried Van Dorn, suddenly. &ldquo;What
do you people demand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We? Oh, sir, we make no demands at all.
Your proposition was, as you doubtless well
knew, one it would be impossible for us to accept.
But we shall keep your secret, never fear, and the
best proof is that we are off for America. You
are at liberty to go ashore and negotiate with
others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be murdered by Abdul Hashim,&rdquo; he
added, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah; that is your affair,&rdquo; I replied, indifferently.</p>
<p>I went on deck with Archie and directed the
men in getting the Ackley cases hoisted from the
hold and swung aboard a small lighter, which
landed them safely on the quay. I intended to
send the boy&rsquo;s two big telescopes with the goods,
but Archie objected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; he whispered to me, soberly. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t yet decided to go ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to deliver your father&rsquo;s goods to the merchants
at Luxor?&rdquo; I asked, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. See here, Sam; I&rsquo;m in on this deal,&rdquo; he
announced, earnestly. &ldquo;If you fellows go fortune-hunting
you must take me along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you want a share, do you?&rdquo; I said, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t refuse a small slice, Sam; but for the
most I&rsquo;m after is the fun. This is the biggest deal
I ever heard of, and it promises a lot of sport
before you&rsquo;re through with it. Let me in, will
you?&rdquo; he added, pleadingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing, Archie. But it&rsquo;s likely we can&rsquo;t
come to terms with the Professor. He don&rsquo;t want
to divvy fair, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little man was now walking disconsolately
about the deck. Apparently he was in a state of
deep dejection.</p>
<p>I went with Archie to the quay, where he paid
the import duties on his father&rsquo;s wares and arranged
to have them forwarded by the railway
to Luxor, where they were consigned to himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, we don&rsquo;t know these Greek and
Syrian merchants,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;and we can&rsquo;t
trust dealers in humbug goods. That&rsquo;s why
father wanted me to come along. I&rsquo;m to collect
for the stuff when I deliver it, and also take orders
for anything more they want us to manufacture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you intend to travel with the
goods?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They can wait at Luxor for me until
we&rsquo;ve decided what to do about the Professor&rsquo;s
treasure. According to his story it lies buried
only a few miles from Luxor, so I may be able to
attend to both errands at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah; if we only knew what this plan was
destined to cost us!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A GREAT UNDERTAKING.</span></h2>
<p>As Archie and I returned along the quay from
the custom house, to regain our boat, I noticed
standing upon the edge of the dock the solitary
but impressive figure of an Arab.</p>
<p>He was fully six feet tall and splendidly
formed. His dirty white burnous was wrapped
around him in a way to emphasize the dignity of
his pose, and his handsome countenance was calm
and impassive. From beneath the ample folds of
a black and yellow turban two wide dark eyes
were set on a point of vision across the bay, and
following his gaze I saw that it was directed
toward the <i>Seagull</i> lying at her anchorage. These
eyes, accustomed to the distances of the desert,
might be stronger than my own, yet I myself
found that I could discern dark forms moving
about upon our deck, and one in especial&mdash;was it
the Professor?&mdash;was leaning quietly over the side
nearest the quay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>The Arab did not notice Archie or me, so I had
a chance to examine him critically. He was not
old&mdash;perhaps thirty-five&mdash;and his unshaven face
was a light tan in color. As we rowed out to the
ship his eyes at last fell upon us, and I thought
that he watched us intently until we were well
aboard. From the deck I could still see his stalwart,
motionless figure standing erect in the same
position; and perhaps the Professor saw him, too,
for he came toward me with an uneasy expression
upon his face and requested another interview
with my father, Uncle Naboth, and myself.</p>
<p>I summoned Ned Britton, Archie, and Joe, as
well, and presently we all assembled in my
father&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking over this proposal,&rdquo;
began Van Dorn, &ldquo;and have concluded that my
first offer was not liberal enough, in the circumstances.
To be frank with you,&rdquo; his little, ferret
eyes were anything but frank, just then, &ldquo;the
treasure is useless to me without your assistance
in obtaining and transporting it to a place of
safety. So I am willing to meet your views in the
matter of a division of the spoils.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>We regarded him silently, and after a moment
he added: &ldquo;What do you think would be just,
or satisfactory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle answered. He was an experienced
trader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to your own story, sir,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you are not the original discoverer of this
treasure. Professor Lovelace worked several
years in tracing it, and finally succeeded because
he had found an obscure diagram engraved on the
ruined walls of a temple. He hired you to assist
him. Tell us, then, what share of the plunder did
he promise you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor hesitated, but thinking to
deceive us, though his manner assured us he was
lying, he said boldly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was to have one-half. But of course after
Lovelace was murdered the whole belonged
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there any compact to that effect?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. But it is reasonable and just, is
it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had Lovelace no heirs&mdash;no family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Uncle Naboth, with his usual deliberation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were to receive one-half the treasure
from Lovelace, in return for your assistance, we
will make the same contract with you in return
for ours. Lovelace seemed to think it was worth
that much, and we will abide by his judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Van Dorn turned red. There was no escape
from the toils he had cast about himself by his
foolish statement. He looked thoughtfully out
of the window, and following his gaze I saw the
solitary Arab still standing on the quay with his
face set in our direction.</p>
<p>A scarcely perceptible tremor seemed to pass
over the Professor&rsquo;s slight frame. He turned to
us with a new animation in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Lovelace reserved for himself the
collection of papyrus rolls,&rdquo; said he, in a brisk
tone. &ldquo;I will do the same. These writings would
be of no value to you, in any event. All of the
jewels, ornaments, or other treasure than the
papyri, I will agree to divide with you equally.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said Uncle Naboth, with a nod.
&ldquo;It is our agreement. Write it down, Sam, and
all these witnesses shall sign the document.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I brought paper and pens and began to draw up
the agreement. Presently I paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In case of your death, Professor, I suppose
you are willing all the treasure should belong to
us, since that was your own claim when Lovelace
died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grew a little pale as he answered: &ldquo;Do you
want to put that in the paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you agree, on your part, to protect me
from harm in all possible ways, to guard my life
as completely as you do your own lives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then include it in the contract. It would be
a terrible thing to die just when all this treasure
is fairly in my grasp; but if I lose my life in the
venture there is no one to inherit my possessions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I resumed my writing Uncle Naboth
remarked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look after you, sir, never fear. Sam
only means to cover any possible mishaps, and I
guess he&rsquo;s right. But we&rsquo;ll be satisfied with a
fair division, and intend to do our duty by you if
it costs us our lives to protect you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the contract was ready the Professor
signed it without a word of protest, and after
the witnesses had attached their signatures the
little man went on deck and left us alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means treachery,&rdquo; remarked my father,
coolly.</p>
<p>Uncle nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite possible, Dick; but it will be our business
to watch him. His story is true, because
he has the evidence to prove it, and I&rsquo;ve no doubt
he&rsquo;ll lead us straight to the treasure. But what
his game is afterwards, I can&rsquo;t imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that we sat silent for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said I, happening to think of the
thing, &ldquo;Archie wants to go along with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins scratched his head reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What share does he want?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>I turned to Archie for the reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m any help to you, you can give me whatever
you please,&rdquo; said the boy. &ldquo;I want to see
the fun, mostly; but I&rsquo;ll not refuse any reward
I&rsquo;m able to earn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fair and square,&rdquo; said Uncle Naboth.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; proclaimed my father, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
got to talk to the men. That&rsquo;s your job, Sam&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
got the gift of palaver. The enterprise is
irreg&rsquo;lar an&rsquo; some dangerous, an&rsquo; our lads must
be told jest what they&rsquo;re expected to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went on deck and piped all hands aft for a
conference.</p>
<p>As clearly as I was able I related to the crew
the story Van Dorn had told us, and his proposal
to us to assist him in getting the treasure. The
only points I concealed were the location of the
hoard and its probable value.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you will join us in this adventure,&rdquo; I
added, &ldquo;we promise every man three times his
regular pay, and in case we get the treasure one-tenth
of our share also be divided equally among
you. We don&rsquo;t expect much trouble, yet there
may be a scrimmage or so with the Arabs before
we get done. Any of you who fear this danger
or don&rsquo;t like the job we&rsquo;ve undertaken, will be left
at Port Said until we return, and we shall think
none the worse of those men, who will simply forfeit
their prize money. Now, lads, what do you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t a dissenting voice among them.
They were Americans. Many had sailed with us
before, and all were picked men who had proved
themselves honest and trustworthy. My father
had indeed chosen his crew with care and judgment,
and I think we were not much surprised
that from Ned Britton down to the meanest sailor
all were eager to undertake the venture.</p>
<p>We cleared the port, sailed down to Port Said,
and paid our fee to be passed through the Suez
Canal to the Gulf of Arabia&mdash;no insignificant
sum, by the way, but an incidental expense of the
enterprise. The Professor had sadly informed
us that he had no ready money to meet any of
these emergencies; therefore we undertook to
pay all expenses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Our last view of the quay at Alexandria
showed the strange Arab still at his post, motionless
and staring calmly after us. I noticed that
Van Dorn heaved a sigh of relief when we drew
away from the harbor and the solitary watcher
had faded slowly from our sight.</p>
<p>We were obliged to lie for four days at Port
Said before our turn came to enter the canal, for
several big liners of the East India Company and
many packets of many nations were before us.
Having our own engines we did not require a tug,
and after a seemingly interminable period,
although the distance is only one hundred miles,
we emerged from the canal at Suez and Port
Ibrahim and found the broad waters of the Red
Sea lying before us.</p>
<p>Heading southward we found fair breezes that
wafted us at a good speed along the two hundred
and fifty miles of barren coast between Suez and
Koser. The Arabian desert, bleak and covered in
places with bare mountains, was in sight on our
right all the way, and the few small villages we
passed did not seem inviting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>At length, on the evening of the 12th of
February, we anchored in the little harbor of
Koser, and although the natives came flocking
around us in their miserable fishing boats, offering
fruit for sale and doubtless wondering what
chance had led so strange and trim a craft as the
<i>Seagull</i> to their forsaken port, we made no
attempt to land or communicate with them until
the next morning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">GEGE-MERAK.</span></h2>
<p>After breakfast Uncle Naboth, the Professor,
and I rowed ashore and landed on the primitive
wooden quay, whence we proceeded to the town&mdash;a
group of mud dwellings, palm thatched,
standing on a small eminence near the bay. At
the left of the town were several large storehouses
belonging to the government, where tithes
of grain were kept.</p>
<p>A silent but observant group of natives met us
on shore and accompanied us up the path to one
of the principal houses, where Van Dorn, who
understood Arabic, informed us the sheik and
cadi awaited our coming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>After a brief delay we were ushered into a low
but spacious room where the light was so dim
that at first I could see nothing. Presently,
however, my eyes grew accustomed to the gloom
and I made out a big, whiskered Arab sitting
cross-legged on a mat and surrounded by a group
of friends and advisors.</p>
<p>To my relief they spoke English; brokenly, yet
sufficiently well to be understood; and the sheik
in most polite phrases begged to know why we
had honored his poor village by a visit.</p>
<p>The Professor explained that our vessel was
bound for India, but that some of our party had
an errand at Luxor and we wished to secure a
guide, an armed escort, and some good camels,
to form a caravan to cross the desert and return.
The ship would wait in the harbor until we had
accomplished our journey.</p>
<p>They listened to this story respectfully. We
were Americans, they judged. Only Americans
in Egypt were credited with doing unusual things.
An Englishman or other foreigner would have
taken the railway to Luxor by way of Cairo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>But they had no desire to grumble at our
strange whim. To keep the ship in their harbor
a week longer would mean more or less patronage
of the village bazar as well as harbor fees for the
sheik. The caravan across the desert would mean
good earnings for many worthy citizens, no
doubt.</p>
<p>But just here they seemed to scent difficulties.
The Arabs talked together earnestly in their own
language, and the Professor explained to us in
an anxious voice that guides were scarce in Koser
just then. The best, a famous Arab Bedouin, had
gone west to the mines on a three weeks&rsquo; journey.
Another had just departed to take a party to Kift.
The third and last one available was lying ill with
a fever. There was no trouble about camels; the
sheik had himself several superior animals to
offer, and a neighbor chief of the Bega Bedouins
owned a splendid drove and could furnish any
number required. But the guide was lacking, and
a guide was absolutely necessary; for the desert
was trackless and infested by <i>haramyeh</i>, or
robbers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>That seemed to settle the matter, to the great
grief of the sheik; but the little Professor protested
most vigorously that he had to go, and
that a way must be found to secure for us a competent
guide. Extra money would be available in
the emergency, he added, and the hint set the
dirty bearded Arabs conferring again. They
talked in Arabic, and I heard the name of Gege-Merak<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
mentioned several times. The Professor,
listening intently, told me this was the Bega chief
who owned the camels. Gege-Merak had once
been the most famous guide on the desert, but he
was now old, and had retired from active life
years ago. Still, if there was plenty of money
to tempt him, he might be induced personally to
lead us to Luxor and back.</p>
<p>The discussion resulted in a messenger being
dispatched to Gege-Merak, who lived a day&rsquo;s
journey in the desert, to propose our offer and
bring back the chief&rsquo;s reply. There would be
nine of our own party, and we desired an escort
of six armed natives, besides the guide.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>The delay was inevitable, and we waited as
patiently as we could for the messenger&rsquo;s return.
That evening we entertained the sheik and his
chief men at dinner aboard the ship, and before
they returned to the shore they vowed undying
friendship for us all, including Nux and Bryonia.
My father&rsquo;s cork leg especially won their admiration
and respect, and they declared he must be a
very great and famous Captain in his own
country to be entrusted with the command of so
noble and so beautiful a ship. We told them he
was. The Professor added that next to the
President himself all Americans revered Captain
Steele, who had won many battles fighting
against his country&rsquo;s enemies. I was amused at
this absurd description, but it afterward served us
a good turn, and perhaps preserved our lives.</p>
<p>The next day we visited the bazar, where
unimportant articles were offered for sale, and
as the sheik was himself the principal owner we
purchased considerable rubbish that we had no
use for, just to keep the rascals good natured.</p>
<p>On the third day, at about sunset, the
messenger returned, and to our surprise he was
accompanied by a train of fifteen camels&mdash;all fine,
strong specimens of these desert steeds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>He had brought bad news for the sheik, though.
Gege-Merak had consented to guide the strangers
in person, but he would supply all the camels,
tents, and blankets himself, and receive all the hire
for them. Moreover, the armed escort must be
all from his own tribe; no dog of an Arab should
have anything to do with his caravan.</p>
<p>The sheik frowned, cursed the impudent Bega,
and swore he would not allow his dear friends,
the Americans, to fall into Gege-Merak&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth and I went out and examined
the escort. They were handsome, well-formed
fellows, with good features and dark, bronze hued
complexions. Their limbs were slender and
almost delicately formed, yet promised strength
and agility. I decided at once that these men
looked less like robbers than the stealthy-eyed,
sly-moving Arabs of the village.</p>
<p>The Ababdeh&mdash;for the Bega warriors belonged
to this caste&mdash;sat their camels stolidly and in
silence, awaiting the acceptance or rejection of the
offer of their chieftain. They were dressed in
coarse woolen robes colored in brilliant native
hues, but they wore no head covering except their
luxuriant, bushy hair, which formed a perfect
cloud around their faces and seemed to me nearly
a foot in thickness. In their girdles were short
knives and each man carried slung across his back
a long, slender rifle with an elaborately engraved
silver stock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>My uncle agreed with me that the escort looked
manly and brave. We concluded there was a
way to satisfy the sheik, so we went back to him
and offered to pay a liberal sum for his permission
to engage Gege-Merak. He graciously consented,
although he warned us that the desert
Bega were not the safest people in the world to
intrust with our lives and that only the fear of
consequences would prevent the Ababdeh chief
from murdering us and rifling our bodies.</p>
<p>The Professor, however, had no such fears.
He confided to us his opinion that we were fortunate
in having no Arabs in our party. In case
we chanced to encounter Abdul Hashim, the Bega
would be more likely to prove faithful than would
the Koser Arabs. All Arabs hate Christians in
their hearts, added the Professor, and most of
the desert tribes, who had existed in Egypt long
before the Arabs overran the country, hated the
Mussulmans as much as the latter hated the
Christians. The Ababdeh tribes were natural
thieves; he could not deny that; but he had reason
to hope for our safe return from our adventure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>For my part I pinned my faith to our stalwart
escort of American sailors, thinking in my pride
and ignorance that any one of them would be
worth six Bega or Arabs if it came to a fight, and
forgetting that the desert is a prison to those who
do not know its trackless wilds.</p>
<p>Desiring as little delay as possible we loaded
the camels that evening with provisions from our
ship and the light baggage, taking no more of
the latter than was absolutely necessary. Bryonia,
who was going with the party, insisted on carrying
certain pots and pans with which to provide
proper meals while en route, and these the Bega
looked upon with absolute disdain. But I was
glad to see our cook&rsquo;s provision for our comfort,
since we were to be gone eight or nine days at
the least.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>Next morning we mounted the camels and set
out. After some careful figuring we had organized
our party as follows: The Professor first, of
course; then Uncle Naboth, Archie Ackley, Joe,
and myself. My father made some objection to
three boys joining the party, but it was an adventure
in which any boy would be eager to
participate, and Joe begged so hard to go along
and was so devoted to me personally that I argued
the matter until Captain Steele gave in and consented.
My father thought he could not ride a
camel in comfort because of his cork leg, so he
remained aboard to look after the ship. He let
Ned Britton join us, though, and three sailors,
all loyal fellows and splendid specimens of American
manhood. This completed our party of nine.
We were all armed with revolvers and repeating
rifles, and felt that in case of attack or interference
we could give a good account of ourselves.</p>
<p>The weather was warm at this season, but
when we started, soon after dawn, a gentle breeze
was coming over the desert and we set out in
good spirits in spite of the fact that the motion of
the camels caused us to sway awkwardly in our
tall saddles. We should get used to this motion
in time, the Professor assured us; but at first it
jolted us terribly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>It seemed as if the entire population of the
village had assembled to see us start, and from
their looks they evidently considered us little less
than madmen. The sheik wished us a safe
journey and promised in the hearing of the Bega
to avenge us in case we met with treachery; but
at the same time, he told the Professor privately,
he refused to guarantee our savage escort in any
particular.</p>
<p>Bidding my father and the crew of the <i>Seagull</i>
a cheery farewell, we left Koser and began our
journey across the desert.</p>
<p>The Ababdeh were silent fellows, but when I
questioned them I found that at least two of their
number understood and spoke English fairly
well. They did not waste words in expressing
themselves, but seemed intelligent and respectful
in their demeanor toward us.</p>
<p>Our progress the first day was slow, for the
way was across heavy sands that tired the camels
to walk upon. We made a halt for luncheon and
at about sundown reached the encampment of the
Bega chief, Gege-Merak. It was situated on a
tiny oasis of the desert, which boasted a well of
good water and a group of a dozen tall spreading
date-palms. Under the palms were set the chief
houses of the village, made of mud and thatched
with palm leaves; but the huts of the people extended
also out upon the desert, on all sides of the
oasis. These mainly consisted of low walls of
mud roofed with squares of canvas, and none save
the house of the chieftain was high enough for a
man to stand upright within it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i_130.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="744" />
<p class="caption">The village in the oasis.</p>
</div>
<p>I was surprised at the number of this isolated
tribe of Bega, and it was a wonder to me how
they all managed to subsist. They had many
goats and camels and a small herd of buffalo-cows&mdash;too
many, seemingly, to crop the scant
herbage of the oasis; but there was no attempt
at agriculture that I could discover.</p>
<p>We halted before the house of the chief, and
after conferring together our escort conducted
my uncle, the Professor, and myself into the
building. We found ourselves in a large, cool
room, lighted and aired by open spaces between
the top of the walls and the roof. At the rear
was a dark passage, doubtless leading into other
apartments, but the appearance of the interior
was extremely primitive and unattractive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Upon a rush mat at one side of the room sat a
young girl, her slender form graceful and upright,
her dark eyes fixed curiously upon us. She
seemed about fifteen years of age, but may have
been two or three years younger, for the women
of these desert gypsies mature early in life. Her
hair, unlike that of the other Bega we had seen,
was not bushy and cloudlike, but its luxuriant
tresses were heavily plaited into several braids,
two hanging in front over either shoulder and
two others dropping behind her back. On her
arms or ankles were broad bands or bracelets of
silver, some of them set with odd stones of
strange colors and shapes. Golden bangles&mdash;perhaps
Persian or Arabian coins&mdash;were strung together
on wires and woven into the braids of her
hair. She wore a robe of some thin, strong material
which was striped in alternate bands of
scarlet and green&mdash;a robe more becoming than
its description sounds, I think&mdash;and across her
rounded shoulders was folded a Syrian scarf covered
with rich embroidery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>The girl was undeniably handsome. She would
have been conspicuous by reason of her beauty in
any civilized community. Here, surrounded by
a barbaric desert tribe, she seemed a veritable
daughter of Venus.</p>
<p>I could not stare long at this gracious sight,
for beside the girl sat, or rather squatted, a personage
whose powerful individuality compelled
attention.</p>
<p>Gege-Merak&mdash;for I did not doubt I beheld the
chief&mdash;was a withered, wrinkled old man scarce
five feet in height when standing upright, a
veritable dwarf among his handsome, well formed
subjects. One eye&mdash;the right one&mdash;was gone,
and across the sightless cavity and reaching from
his cheek to his forehead, was a broad, livid scar
as from the slash of a knife or a sword-cut. The
other eye, small and glittering, regarded us with
a glare as disconcerting as that of a snake, it
being set in his face deep amid the folds of
wrinkled flesh. His chin protruded and his thin
lips were closed together in a straight line, while
his bushy hair was snow-white in color, denoting
great age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>I own I was amazed to find the famous chief
so different from his people; and when I realized
that we had voluntarily put our lives into the
keeping of this old, evil-featured Bega, I began
to suspect there was a foundation for the Arab
sheik&rsquo;s persistent croak of danger. Still, as Gege-Merak
sat huddled upon his mat, motionless save
for that roving, terrible eye, it occurred to me
that he was too old and feeble to lead the caravan
himself, as he had sent word to us that he would
do, and without doubt would delegate the task
to some other.</p>
<p>At our entrance the warriors knelt to their
chief and crouched subserviently their foreheads
to the mat; but afterward they stood erect in
a group at one side. They neither saluted nor
appeared to notice the girl at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Gege-Merak, in a quiet voice and
speaking excellent English. &ldquo;Here are the travelers
who wish to be led to Luxor. What is your
errand there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked from one to another of us, and I
took upon myself to answer him, as the Professor
seemed to hesitate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, that is our business alone,&rdquo; I declared,
stiffly. &ldquo;All that we require from you is your
camels, your warriors to guard us, and a guide.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am rebuked, Effendi,&rdquo; said he, fixing his
small eye upon me with a penetrating gaze, but
exhibiting no humility in his tones. After a
slight pause: &ldquo;Do you agree to my price in return
for the service you require?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you are to receive one hundred English
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In advance,&rdquo; he added, softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One-half in advance,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;The remainder
when we have returned in safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I produced a bag containing fifty gold pounds,
and stooping down counted them out upon the
mat before him. He watched me silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I will see the other fifty,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I began to dislike the chief; but now the Professor
said, somewhat to my surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay him the full amount, Mr. Steele; it will
be better that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked, turning to him rather angrily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because the great chief is suspicious of our
honesty, and we want him to believe we are honest.
Also because Gege-Merak&rsquo;s word is sacred,
and he will be faithful when he is paid. For a
third reason, it will be just as well for you not to
carry that gold across the desert and back again,
when the chief is able to put it away in a safe
place before we begin the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gege-Merak listened carefully and it was evident
he approved this argument. But he said
nothing and merely looked at me inquiringly.</p>
<p>Of course, if the natives would prove faithful,
the Professor&rsquo;s plan of advance payment was
best. After a look toward Uncle Naboth, which
he answered with a nod, I drew out another fifty
pounds and counted it upon the mat beside the
first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Gege-Merak,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are paid in
full.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ACROSS THE BLACK MOUNTAINS.</span></h2>
<p>The cruel little eye of the chief twinkled
brightly at sight of all this golden display, but
he made no motion to gather it up. Instead, he
turned his keen glance first upon me and then
upon the others of our party, as if striving to
gauge our thoughts, and read our secret characters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see the other Americans,&rdquo; he finally
said.</p>
<p>The Professor summoned Ned Britton, Archie,
Joe, Bry, and the sailors, and soon they all stood
wonderingly before the Bega chief. He examined
each one with silent interest, down to the
smallest item of attire. He nodded and asked
them to again withdraw.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Effendi,&rdquo; said he, addressing me when the
others were gone, &ldquo;you are deceiving me in regard
to your errand. Your party is strong and
heavily armed. You ask me for brave warriors
to assist you, and for my own services as guide.
All this is not usual with peaceful traders or travelers
who wish to cross the desert to Luxor on an
errand of simple business. Another thing. You
willingly pay me a big price&mdash;more than my service
is really worth. Again, you ask for two extra
camels, bearing empty saddle-bags. Therefore
you have a secret intention you do not reveal to
me. The little red-beard&rsquo;s eyes are bright with
fever. You all expect trouble. You may get me
mixed with your trouble, so that the authorities
will imprison me and scatter my tribe. I am a
good subject of the mighty Sultan and our father
the Khedive. Therefore I refuse the compact.
Take your gold, Effendi, and return to Koser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech of the wily chief fairly took away
my breath. Uncle Naboth seemed disappointed,
and the Professor trembled nervously. I am
sure our various emotions were clearly apparent
to Gege-Merak, for his roving eye bore an expression
of grim amusement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>It was the Professor who finally answered.
He knew the covert disposition of these strange
people better than we did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, then, my brother, how much we trust in
your friendship and honesty,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Our
errand is indeed twofold, as you have wisely suspected.
One part is to permit the young effendi,
Archie Ackley, whom you have just seen, to collect
pay for his wares from certain merchants
in Luxor. The second part of our errand is to
permit me to secure some property belonging to
me which I left concealed in a part of the desert
near Karnak. Our bargain with you is to guide
and escort us safely to these places and enable
us to bring back to our ship at Koser the property
I have mentioned and young Ackley&rsquo;s payments
from the merchants. For our purpose of
transportation the two extra camels will be sufficient.
But we shall have no trouble with the
authorities, because we intend to commit no
crime and break no law of the land. I will not
conceal from you the fact that I am at enmity
with a miserable Arab sheik named Abdul
Hashim, who lives upon the desert near Luxor
and who might try to prevent me from securing
my property if he knew I had come for it. He
does not suspect my journey at present, and I
hope to avoid him altogether, since he is just
now under the displeasure of the Khedive&rsquo;s police,
which has destroyed his village and scattered
his lawless band. But we must go armed
in case the Arab dares to molest us, and part of
your liberal payment is to fight well for us if
there should be need. Also, bands of robbers
infest the desert, and we do not wish to be robbed
on our journey. So we take all needful precautions.
Is the great and wise chief, my brother,
now satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Gege-Merak was silent for a time, thoughtfully
studying the mat at his feet. Then he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Abdul Hashim. He is a jackal. I
know the police have destroyed his village, as
you truly say; but he is rebuilding it. Abdul
Hashim has powerful friends, and he will fight
his foes in spite of our father the Khedive. If I
accept your offer I may lose many camels and
men. Also I make a foe forever of Abdul
Hashim and his tribe. No; I will not consent;
the hundred gold pounds is not enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>He had caught us fairly. I saw plainly enough
that we must either abandon the adventure altogether
or consent to be robbed at the start by
this grasping Bega. The Professor asked permission
for us to withdraw and consult together,
and we went into the open air to hold a conference.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth asked the Professor how much
he judged the treasure to be worth. We had
already invested a considerable sum in the speculation
and were about to risk our lives as well.</p>
<p>Van Dorn could only estimate the amount of
the treasure, of which he had obtained merely a
glimpse. But he thought its total value could
not possibly equal less than five hundred thousand
pounds, or two and a half million dollars in
American money. It was well worth doubling
the chief&rsquo;s bribe, he urged, and we all were loth
to retreat on the eve of our adventure. We
decided to win Gege-Merak&rsquo;s support at all hazards,
and presently stood again in the presence
of the chief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>He sat just as we had left him, with the beautiful,
statuesque girl at his side, and the money
still spread before him on the mat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said the Professor, &ldquo;we have counselled
together and decided that your demands
are not unfriendly. For your powerful support,
for the risk you take and the assurance that you
will stand by us bravely and faithfully, we will
double the price first agreed upon. Twenty
pounds more we will give you now. It is all
the remaining money we brought with us. But
upon our return to the ship we will give you
eighty pounds in addition, making two hundred
pounds in all. Does this satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; was the quiet answer. &ldquo;Give me the
twenty pounds and your writing to pay me one
hundred and eighty pounds more on our return
to the ship and I shall be content. If any of my
men are killed in fighting I will say nothing. If
any of your party is killed you shall not blame
me in any way. Make a writing as I have said
and I will be true to you. This is my last word.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>I groaned in spirit at the necessity, but I tore
a leaf from my notebook and with my fountain
pen wrote the agreement. Uncle Naboth and the
Professor added their signatures to mine. It was
a great sum in Egypt, this fifteen hundred dollars,
and we had promised not to hold Gege-Merak
responsible if any of us lost our lives in
the venture. But the Professor assured us we
had won a powerful ally and that the investment
was warranted by our necessity.</p>
<p>I gave the Bega chief the paper, which I felt
sure he could not read, and counted out our remaining
twenty pounds upon the mat. Thereupon
he spoke to the girl in his native tongue,
for the Bega have a language of their own, although
they usually speak a hybrid Arabic. She
leaned forward, calmly gathered up the money
in her scarf, arose and left the room by the dark
passage. She was tall for her age and moved
with grace and dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At daybreak,&rdquo; said Gege-Merak, &ldquo;the caravan
will be ready to start. I shall go with you.
To-night my brothers will sleep in a house prepared
for you. Ketti will lead you to it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>The young warrior who had guided us to the
village from Koser now came forward and bowed
to us respectfully. We nodded farewell to the
chief and followed Ketti to a large house of one
bare room, where our entire party shortly assembled.
Bry had already brought out his pots
and pans and soon a good supper was ready for
us. Appetites are keen upon the desert, and the
evening was already well advanced when we had
finished the repast. Soon after, tired by our
first day of camel riding, we rolled ourselves in
our blankets and fell asleep.</p>
<p>I was roused even before daybreak by the
noise and shouting in the village. Every inhabitant
seemed astir and in a state of wild excitement,
yet there was nothing for our party to do
but fold our blankets and eat the breakfast our
black cook quickly served us. At first we
stumbled around blindly in the gloom, but gradually
the sky grew lighter, until suddenly the
first red beams of the sun shot over the edge of
the desert. Beside the well and just in front of
the chief&rsquo;s house the camels were assembled, all
bridled and saddled and ready for the journey.
We took the beasts assigned us and mounted to
our places while the obedient creatures knelt to
receive their burdens. The entire population of
the village stood around, silent now, but observant,
to watch the start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>When we were ready I noticed that two of
the camels still knelt awaiting their riders. They
bore gorgeous trappings, the saddles being
studded with brass and silver ornaments. The
delay was brief, for soon the little old chief came
from his house, followed by the girl we had seen
the night before.</p>
<p>I had wondered how Gege-Merak, who had
seemed to be nothing more than a withered,
dried-up mummy, could by any possibility be able
to lead the caravan in person; but now, to my
surprise, he advanced with swift steps, agile and
light as the tread of a panther, and seated himself
upon his kneeling camel. His one bright eye
roved over the assembled villagers, who all prostrated
themselves an instant before resuming
their former upright positions. The chief was
clad in the same bright colored burnous he had
worn the night before. An old-fashioned pistol
was stuck in his sash and at his side hung a Turkish
cimetar with a jeweled handle. When his
camel had risen to its feet Gege-Merak made a
brief speech to the villagers and gave the signal
to start.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>The girl, meantime, had quietly mounted the
other camel and taken her place beside the chief.
No one saluted her or seemed to notice her presence,
yet to me she was scarcely less interesting
than her aged companion. The Bega women
were numerous in the village, were generally
good looking and bold in their demeanor, yet the
warriors seemed to make a point of disregarding
them altogether, as if the sex was wholly unworthy
of masculine attention. It seemed to be
a Bega characteristic and partly explained why
the chief&rsquo;s companion was so generally ignored,
but I was curious to know something of the girl
who was to accompany us. So as we rode slowly
away from the oasis I asked Ketti, who was near
me, who she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gege-Merak&rsquo;s grandchild,&rdquo; was the answer,
and I thought the young warrior&rsquo;s eyes rested for
an instant upon the young girl with a gleam of
admiration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will she succeed the chief, when he dies?&rdquo; I
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Effendi. Iva is but a woman. Only a
man becomes chief of a Bega tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. In our country, Ketti, a woman is
considered equal to a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made no reply to the observation and after
a moment I continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, then, why does Iva ride with us
on this journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He frowned, glancing around sharply to see
that we were not overheard. But we had ridden
quite out of earshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Effendi, we speak little of such matters, but
it is the superstition of Gege-Merak. He believes
that he will live as long as his grandchild lives,
but no longer. If she dies, then he will die.
Allah has decreed it. For this reason the chief
does not dare to leave her behind, lest some
harm happen to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>I laughed at this explanation, but the warrior&rsquo;s
face was grave. He was by far the handsomest
and most intelligent of our escort, and his
dignified and straightforward expression attracted
me toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always the chief does not treat Iva well,&rdquo;
he added, as if to himself, as he glanced again to
where the oddly mated couple rode at the head
of the caravan. &ldquo;Her health he guards, because
he is selfish; but he makes the girl his slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It occurred to me I had been right in guessing
that the young man entertained a tender feeling
toward Iva. But I could scarcely blame him.
She was very attractive&mdash;for a Bega.</p>
<p>We made toward a dim ridge of mountains
that showed at the southeast and during the day
drew gradually nearer to them. At night we
encamped in the foothills. The rocks were bare
and of a black color, and the surrounding landscape
was wholly uninviting. Just beyond us the
hills grew to mountains, which formed a
seemingly endless range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we climb those peaks?&rdquo; I asked the chief,
as our followers prepared the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are passes between them, which we
follow for two days,&rdquo; he answered, briefly.
Ketti told me they were the Hammemat
Mountains, composed of a hard, dark stone called
breccia, and that the ancient Egyptians had
quarries here, using the stone to form their
statues from.</p>
<p>From this first night the native and American
camps were separate. The Begas pitched low
tents for our use, but on their side only one
tent, for the use of Iva, was set up. The men,
including the aged chief, when they slept simply
rolled themselves in their <i>abayeh</i> or ragged
blankets and lay down upon the sand.</p>
<p>Bryonia, having brought a couple of sacks
of charcoal from Koser to use for fuel, managed
to cook us a good supper. The Bega did no
cooking, but satisfied their hunger with hard
bread and dried goat&rsquo;s flesh, washed down with
a swallow or two of tepid water. We invited
Gege-Merak and Iva to join us at our meal,
but the chief curtly refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I eat with my people,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>This action seemed to worry the Professor
and his face grew anxious and thoughtful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Gege-Merak had broken bread with us,
or eaten of our salt,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;we might
have depended upon his faithfulness at all times.
It is a rather suspicious circumstance, to my
mind, that he refuses to join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust him at all,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor do I,&rdquo; added Uncle Naboth. &ldquo;Seemed
to me, first time I spotted the rascal, that he
was playin&rsquo; a deep game. Don&rsquo;t you think it was
foolish, Professor, to pay him all that money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. If we had refused to pay it he
might have robbed us of it on the journey. Now
he knows he can get nothing more from us until
we return to the ship. That will be our salvation,
I imagine. To get the balance of his payment
he&rsquo;ll be sure to return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he doesn&rsquo;t agree to bring us all back
with him,&rdquo; observed Archie, musingly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
be entitled to the money, just the same, if a few
of us are killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That matter,&rdquo; said Ned Britton, grimly, &ldquo;we
must attend to ourselves. There are nine o&rsquo; us
to six o&rsquo; them copperheads, for the girl don&rsquo;t
count. So I guess they&rsquo;ll think twice afore they
attacks us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fear any open rupture,&rdquo; replied
Van Dorn, with a moody glance toward the Bega
camp. &ldquo;What we must guard against is
treachery. If the chief had eaten with us I
should have feared nothing; but I know the ways
of these Begas, and it will be best for us to set
a guard every night while we sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s nothing to murder us for at
present,&rdquo; I objected. &ldquo;When we get the
treasure, if we ever do, it will be another matter.
Just now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jest now,&rdquo; interrupted Uncle Naboth, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll
keep on the safe side and take the Perfessor&rsquo;s
hint. Snakes is snakes, an&rsquo; you can&rsquo;t tell when
they&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; to strike. Let&rsquo;s set a watch
nights, from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion was a reasonable one, and
we determined to follow it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DEEP IN THE DESERT SANDS.</span></h2>
<p>The second day&rsquo;s journey was through wild
passes of the Hammemat, among which we might
easily have become bewildered and lost our way
had not Gege-Merak&rsquo;s knowledge of the
mountains enabled him to guide us accurately.
We passed an old Egyptian mine and, soon after,
the quarries which they had abandoned centuries
ago, and at evening came to the famous
well of Bir-Hammemat, the curb of which is
sixteen feet in diameter. Here we made our
camp, and so wild was the spot that we kept
a constant though secret watch throughout the
night. The Bega, however, seemed to harbor
no thoughts of treachery, and although they
made their camp on the opposite side of the well
from our own they neither by look nor action
gave us cause to suspect their loyalty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>We emerged among the foothills on the third
day, and before noon passed a landmark in the
way of an old Roman well, now dry and
abandoned. It had once been a large cavity,
walled up with huge layers of stone, and I
imagined it must originally have been very deep,
too, for even yet the rubbish in its bottom was
a good fifteen feet from the curb. I glanced
at the place carelessly enough as we passed,
never dreaming of the tragedy soon to be enacted
there.</p>
<p>Pushing on at excellent speed we mounted
more rocky hills, here composed of yellow and
red Nubian sandstone and granite. Just at
sundown we reached the Pass of Mutrok without
incident.</p>
<p>The Professor was excellently satisfied with
our progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;Four hours across the desert from here,&rdquo;
he told us at supper, &ldquo;lies the small village of
Laketa, which is but four hours more from
Luxor. The treasure lies some two hours&rsquo;
journey from Laketa, toward Karnak, and my
plan is to halt at the village, when we reach
it, and leave our native escort there. I can
guide you myself from Laketa, so only the
Americans shall go to the place where the
treasure lies hid. We shall take with us the two
extra camels, and when we rejoin the Bega
we must keep these camels constantly with our
party, and refuse to tell the chief or any of his
followers what load they bear. This is a
necessary precaution, I assure you. So far our
journey has been uneventful, but once we have
secured the treasure we must exercise exceptional
caution and vigilance until we get it safely aboard
the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was good and timely advice, we well
knew, and Van Dorn&rsquo;s plan seemed practical
enough. Before leaving the ship our sailmaker
had prepared several large canvas bags for
holding the treasure, and the Professor had
brought along a supply of sealing-wax with which
to seal up the treasure in the bags until it was
delivered on board the ship and could be
appraised and divided between us. According
to his recollection of the cavity and its size Van
Dorn judged that two camels would be ample
to transport all its contents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>During this third day the Bega had seemed
to regard us with less friendly glances than
before, and just as we dismounted at the camp
an unpleasant incident occurred that for a time
promised open rupture between us.</p>
<p>One of the camels having gone lame during
the afternoon, Iva had been transferred from
her own beast to that of the chief, riding behind
whom she finished the journey in no very
comfortable manner. The girl, proud and
reserved, speaking seldom and then only in
monosyllables, seemed wholly out of place in this
caravan of men, and we realized that the chief&rsquo;s
absurd superstition about her was responsible
for much of her sullen behavior.</p>
<p>Iva had ridden in a cramped position until
her limbs were numbed, and as she slid off the
kneeling camel she stumbled and fell awkwardly
against the chief. In sudden rage Gege-Merak
turned and struck her a blow on the side of her
head, and the next instant he found himself
tumbling headlong to the earth. For Archie had
happened to stand near, and seeing the outrageous
act had bowled over the great Gege-Merak
as coolly as if he had been a school-boy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>Even before the chief could rise the Bega had
sprung at us with drawn knives and leveled
pistols; but Gege-Merak, hearing their shout
of rage, rolled over and held up an arm in
warning. They slunk back, then, while Ketti
assisted the ancient chief to his feet. He was
unhurt, for his mummified little form was tough
as leather. Neither had Iva been much injured
by the blow she had received, for she stood by
quiet and submissive to all appearances. But
I had caught a fierce gleam in her dark eyes that
proved she secretly resented her brutal treatment.
The sharp edge of one of her clumsy ear ornaments
had cut her cheek, and two or three tiny
drops of blood trickled down her face; but this
was unimportant. She well knew Gege-Merak
would take good care not to seriously endanger
her health or life, even in a fit of temper, as long
as his superstition regarding her held sway. But
a kick, a blow, or a bitter epithet was often her
portion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>This was not the end of the incident. After
supper and during the brief Egyptian twilight
Ketti came to us with a message from the chief.
He asked us to kill Archie before morning and
expose his body to be torn and devoured by the
jackals, that the insult to Gege-Merak&rsquo;s dignity
be avenged.</p>
<p>We greeted the request with a roar of laughter,
and Archie declared he would run across and
punch the old fellow&rsquo;s nose for his impudence.
Ketti, who was less a barbarian than any of his
tribe, in our opinion, was still too dense to understand
our answer until we said frankly that
we fully approved what Archie had done and
had no intention of punishing him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the messenger, &ldquo;you must deliver
him to our chief, who will satisfy his vengeance
according to our customs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Ketti,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a good
fellow, and I&rsquo;ll explain to you our position. The
poorest American is of higher rank than the most
important Bega that lives, and your Gege-Merak
is merely our servant, having accepted our pay.
Aside from that, we Americans won&rsquo;t allow any
woman of any race to be abused in our presence,
and you might tell your wicked old chief that
if he dares to touch the girl again while in our
company, we&rsquo;ll tie him up and horsewhip him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Ketti listened to this speech with keen interest.
Perhaps he secretly approved our stand, for his
expression was thoughtful rather than angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not send this message by me, Effendi,&rdquo;
said he, in a low voice. &ldquo;It will mean to fight,
and that must not be&mdash;for we are friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we, Ketti?&rdquo; I inquired, doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your friend,&rdquo; answered the warrior,
evasively. &ldquo;But our chief is proud, for he is the
father of all the Bega of Egypt, our tribe being
the head tribe of our people, and the Arabs and
Turks have taught us that the whites are but
dogs, and have no rank. It will make danger
for you to defy Gege-Merak tonight. Tell him
you will punish the Archie-boy when you reach
your ship, in your own way, which is to cut him
in pieces and feed him to the fishes; once we
knew a ship-sailor who did that and the promise
will make Gege-Merak content.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Ketti,&rdquo; broke in the Professor,
nervously; &ldquo;deliver that or any other message
you like, and we&rsquo;ll remember your friendship
when we get back to Koser. Say anything to
your chief that will restore peace between us, for
we must remain friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ketti nodded understandingly and returned to
his people. Doubtless he promised the old ruffian
that we would take ample vengeance upon our
companion, for we could hear his voice declaiming
loudly our reply before all the tribesmen.
Gege-Merak&rsquo;s dignity was thus restored at little
expense to us, and we heard no more of the
matter. The incident, however, showed us that
we stood in a delicate position and that our
protective escort might at any moment become
our most vindictive enemy.</p>
<p>Next morning we slept late and resumed our
journey at leisure. The Professor told the chief
that we should not require his escort beyond the
village of Laketa. He might remain there with
his band and rest until we were ready to begin
the return journey, probably upon the following
day. Gege-Merak listened quietly and made no
comment beyond saying that his people were
our servants and that to hear was to obey&mdash;an
Oriental figure of speech that meant nothing
at all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>After leaving the mountains a series of low
bleak hills had been encountered, and about the
middle of this forenoon we reached the ruins of
the old Roman hydrauma, or caravan station,
long since abandoned. Three miles farther
brought us within sight of Laketa, a small group
of mud huts occupying an oasis which boasted
two small wells and five palm trees.</p>
<p>We were at the village before noon, and found
ourselves greeted by a dozen Bisharin, men,
women, and children. They were small, skinny
people, naked except for a loin cloth, and having
bushy hair saturated with foul smelling grease.
The Bisharin claim kinship to the Bega nation,
but are much inferior in physique or intelligence
to the Ababdeh who formed our escort. They
are great thieves, as are all these gypsy Bedouins,
but, too cowardly to fight in the open, they
prefer to creep upon their victims unobserved
and stick a knife or short spear into their backs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>These natives of Laketa, however, lived so
near to Luxor and civilization that they had lost
much of their native fierceness and were a cowed
and humble group. They welcomed Gege-Merak
joyously, knowing him as a great chief; but they
stood more in awe of us than they did of their
visiting allies. The Professor assured us that
we had nothing to fear from them. He had often
been to this village with Lovelace, during the
time they were engaged upon their tedious search
for the treasure, and the Bisharin knew him and
treated the little &ldquo;red-beard&rdquo; with profound
respect.</p>
<p>We made our camp beside one of the wells,
while our escort encamped beside the other,
situated on the opposite side of the group of huts.
During the afternoon we rested from the fatigue
of our journey and perfected our plans, canvassing
all matters of detail in the presence of our
entire party, so that every man, even to black
Bry, might understand exactly what our
intentions were and what work would probably
be required of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>We informed Gege-Merak that we should ride
that evening to a place near Luxor, where the
Professor would gather his belongings and pack
them on the two extra camels. Most of us would
return during the night or at daybreak; all would
again be assembled at the oasis by noon, when
the return journey would be begun. We should
camp the next night at our old station in the
mountain pass, which could easily be reached
before dark.</p>
<p>It was all simple and easily understood, and
the chief appeared to be satisfied with the
arrangement. We had an early supper and at
sundown our band of Americans departed, taking
the direction of Luxor and using as a landmark
the low hill called Tel-Ambra, lying southward
of the village. The Bega gathered in a silent
group to watch us move slowly over the desert,
but night soon fell and they must have shortly
lost sight of us in the gloom.</p>
<p>The Professor knew this territory by heart.
There was no moon, and even the stars lacked
their usual brilliance because of fleecy clouds that
moved swiftly across the sky&mdash;an unusual sight
in Egypt. Such clouds, when they appear,
contain no moisture, but are what are called
&ldquo;smoke clouds.&rdquo; There was plenty of light to
guide us, however, so the Professor was sure
of his route.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>In an hour and a half we passed around the
base of Tel-Ambra, which is a barren rock
cropping out of the desert, some twenty feet in its
highest part and about half a mile in circumference.
Skirting this rock we turned abruptly
to the north, altering our course decidedly, for
our first direction was only undertaken to deceive
the Bega.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes of this northerly course brought
us in sight of a group of three straggling palms
which showed like black streaks against the sky;
but now the Professor called a sudden halt, and
I could hear him storming and cursing in low
but tense tones as he sat his camel and glanced
around him observantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, sir?&rdquo; I asked, coming to his
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That scoundrelly Arab, Abdul Hashim, has
rebuilt his village,&rdquo; he answered, with evident
chagrin. &ldquo;The police tore down every wall and
scattered the stones far and wide; but here they
are piled up again to form houses, and even the
roofs of some are newly thatched.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>He pointed away to the left, and the stars
being bright at the time I had no trouble in
perceiving that we had halted a few hundred
yards from a native village. But it was black
and seemed deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; I asked, impatiently.
&ldquo;We can surely keep away from Abdul Hashim
and his people until morning, and by that time
we ought to have gained possession of the
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head, doubtfully; but
he gave the command to march and we hurried
away from this dangerous vicinity and
approached the group of palms. The feet of the
camels made no noise on the desert sands and our
people were all too anxious and intent upon the
adventure to speak unnecessarily; so like shadows
we passed through the shifting and ghostly light
that reached us from the stars, and soon gained
our destination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>I had often wondered, in thinking upon the
subject, how the Professor would be again
enabled to locate with any degree of accuracy
the buried treasure, situated as it was in a barren
spot where the sand drove over it with every
breeze. So now I watched him curiously as he
dismounted at the palms and, drawing a line
from one of the trees to another, seemed to pick
out a star straight ahead to guide him and began
pacing his way regularly over the desert. He
gained an absolute regularity of pace in an
amusing and ingenious, yet simple manner,
attaching a cord from one of his ankles to the
other, after carefully measuring its length.
Consequently all his paces were mathematically
equal, or could vary but slightly.</p>
<p>The rest of us followed him silently. I tried
at first to count the number of paces, but from
my high seat presently lost track of the count.
But I had no idea it would matter to us; we
should never be likely to visit this weird spot a
second time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>At last the Professor came to a sudden halt
and held up his hand. We leaped from our
camels without waiting for them to kneel and
two of our sailors promptly produced shovels
from their panniers and began to dig in the spot
the Professor indicated. They worked with
steady industry, you may be sure, and we took
turns relieving them at the task, for shoveling
sand is by no means an easy job.</p>
<p>After going a certain depth without finding the
granite slab we began making our pit wider, and
within an hour a shovel wielded by Bryonia
bounded back with a metallic sound that told
us the search had finally been successful.</p>
<p>While the men quickly cleared away the
remaining sand, disclosing three bronze rings
imbedded in an oblong slab of granite, I could
not help marveling at the Professor&rsquo;s cleverness
in locating the spot so accurately after several
weeks of absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a matter of simple mathematics,&rdquo; he
explained, while he watched the sand fly with
eager eyes. &ldquo;The only thing that could interfere
with my calculations would be the removal of
the palm trees. But I did not fear that, as they
are centuries old.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>The big stone was now cleared of sand. The
three sailors and Ned Britton stooped and put
their shoulders to the slab, raising the ponderous
weight slowly but surely until it stood upright
on its edge. Then the Professor knelt down and
with nervous haste threw out the padding of
dried rushes and the thick layers of rotted
mummy cloth that covered the contents of the
vault.</p>
<p>Now, more gently, he began removing a
number of bandaged cylinders, something like
eighteen inches long and six inches in diameter.
These, I supposed, were the rolls of papyrus bark
that told the history of that dark period of Egypt
between the Sixth and Twelfth Dynasties. From
the tenderness with which Van Dorn handled
these rolls&mdash;which he rewrapped in new canvas,
sealed securely and then handed to Ned to be
placed in one of the panniers&mdash;I had no doubt
he considered them the most valuable and important
part of the treasure. There were sixteen
rolls; all of them, according to our bargain, Van
Dorn&rsquo;s personal property. After these had been
cared for the Professor threw aside another
layer of bandages and then, at last, the more
tangible wealth of the powerful priests of Karnak
was revealed to our wondering eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Under the dim stars we could see the sparkle
of many rich jewels and the gleam of a vast store
of golden vases, exquisitely worked; of many
chains, bracelets and other ornaments; of pearls
and precious stones. Indeed, the pit seemed full
of the queer and valuable things.</p>
<p>Van Dorn did not pause an instant to admire
this gorgeous sight. He took one of the canvas
sacks which Ned handed him and began filling
it with the jewels. It was difficult to see just
what they were, but the Professor took all that
came to his hand and soon had filled the sack.
He tied its mouth securely and brought out his
sealing wax. When he lighted a match to melt
the wax its rays illumined the pit, and I drew
a deep breath of wonder at the splendor that met
my eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah; treasure!&rdquo; said a soft voice beside me.</p>
<p>Startled, we all sprang up at the words and
found squatting beside the pit the form of the
withered Bega chief, Gege-Merak.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">TAKING CHANCES.</span></h2>
<p>The Professor gave a cry of positive terror,
and before it was well out of his throat Ned
Britton had made a leap and pinioned the chief
to the ground with the weight of his huge form.</p>
<p>We were all greatly startled; and dismayed,
as well, for it seemed that in spite of all our
precautions Gege-Merak had spied upon us and
the secret of the treasure now extended to him&mdash;the
most uncomfortable confederate, from our
standpoint, we could possibly have gained.
Already an enemy, and more powerful in this
country, his own, than we were; animated by the
unscrupulous cupidity of his race and reckless&mdash;as
his people are&mdash;of any consequences that
follow lawless acts, Gege-Merak was the last
person we would have chosen to share our important
secret. The worst feature of the whole
matter was that we ourselves were defying the
laws of Egypt in stealthily removing this vast
hoard, hidden by Egyptian priests long before
the present rulers had ever set foot in the land.
If the government suspected our act we should
all be summarily imprisoned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>No doubt the Bega chief knew very well our
predicament, and that we could not appeal to the
authorities whatever injury he might inflict upon
us; so he would be inclined to fight us for the
possession of the treasure, if any dependence
could be placed upon the native character. If we
tried to compromise, then a large share of our
find must go to Gege-Merak; but he was not
likely to be satisfied with a little.</p>
<p>These thoughts doubtless flashed across every
mind in the pause that followed Ned&rsquo;s capture
of the spy. I know, anyway, that they passed
rapidly through my own mind, and appalled me.</p>
<p>Two of the sailors had sprung forward to assist
the mate, and now they produced several lengths
of cord from their pockets&mdash;every sailor carries
such things&mdash;and the chief was soon fast bound
and laid upon the sand a few paces away. One
of the sailors was left sitting beside him as a
guard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>While the Professor nervously continued to
fill the canvas bags from the pit and to seal each
one securely, we counselled together in whispers
as to the best method of dealing with Gege-Merak.
The sailors and Bryonia loaded the sacks
into the panniers of the camels, which were
strongly woven of rushes, as fast as they were
filled and sealed, and still the pit seemed to
contain as many jewels and precious stones as had
been removed. We began to tremble with a
realization of the hugeness of the treasure, and
to understand that in spite of our ample provision
to carry it, some must be left behind. But that
meant turning it over to the chief, who now
knew its location, unless&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gege-Merak must die!&rdquo; growled the little
Professor, through his teeth. His face was pale
and his eyes were glittering with excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Some of us breathed deeply; but none made
reply in words. I dreaded the necessity as much
as any one could, but saw clearly that the chief&rsquo;s
death was inevitable. It meant not only our
protection, but perhaps our salvation. We were
now burdened with too vast a store of wealth
to be safe on the desert for a single moment,
if Gege-Merak was to be at large to dog our steps.</p>
<p>We now implored the Professor to return the
papyrus rolls to the cavity and take instead more
of the treasure; but Van Dorn obstinately refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my own share, and you have agreed
I should take it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;There are millions
in gold and precious gems, besides; isn&rsquo;t that
enough to satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this may be our last chance at the
treasure,&rdquo; replied Uncle Naboth, anxiously.</p>
<p>The Professor gave him a queer look. It
seemed defiant and half threatening, but
a moment later he dropped his head to resume his
work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; he snapped, wrathfully.
&ldquo;The stuff has lain here for ages, and what
we now leave will remain in safety until we can
come again&mdash;unless we give Gege-Merak a chance
to grab it. We mustn&rsquo;t do that, gentlemen.
If the chief lives he will never allow us to reach
the ship again; you may be sure of that. We&rsquo;ve
had evidence already of his grasping disposition.
It&rsquo;s our lives against his, now, and we must not
hesitate to save ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the chief here, Cunningham,&rdquo; called
Uncle Naboth, peering through the gloom where
our sailor sat upon the sand guarding his prisoner.</p>
<p>Cunningham did not move, and Uncle Naboth
called again. Then Joe ran across to him, bent
over, and gave a cry that raised us all to our
feet in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Gege-Merak
is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true enough. The wily chief had
managed to slip his bonds and plunge a knife
to the heart of his unsuspecting guard before
he crawled away into the night and escaped.</p>
<p>We were horrified at the disaster. Our fears
had now become realities, and as we looked
gravely into one another&rsquo;s eyes under the dim
stars we realized that our lives were in deadly
peril.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lot of clods&mdash;of duffers&mdash;of fools!&rdquo;
screamed the Professor, stamping the ground
in furious rage. &ldquo;You deserve to die for being
so clumsy; you deserve to lose the treasure you
are not clever enough to guard! Bah! to think
I have leagued myself with idiots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archie grabbed him by the shoulder and gave
him a good shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, you red-whiskered ape!&rdquo; he said,
menacingly. &ldquo;Keep a civil tongue in your head,
or I&rsquo;ll skin you alive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were all irritated and unnerved, and I
tried to quiet both Archie and Van Dorn, and to
bring them to a more reasonable frame of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use crying over spilt milk,&rdquo; said
I. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s face the peril like men, and do our best
to get the treasure safely to the ship. Even
if Gege-Merak gets the rest, we have a fortune
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get that, too,&rdquo; groaned the Professor.
&ldquo;The chief has more cunning than the whole
crowd of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>The two camels were now heavily loaded with
the sealed canvas sacks containing the treasure
and the library of historic papyri. We next
strapped the four panniers to the two beasts&mdash;one
on either side of each camel&mdash;and Van Dorn
with the remainder of his wax smeared the
buckles so that if the panniers were opened or
tampered with we should speedily know the fact.
He did not trust us wholly, it seemed, nor did
we fully trust him. The man had been acting
ugly of late, and the fact that we had no chance
to examine any of the treasure we had so quickly
thrust into the sacks made it necessary that the
seals remain intact until we could open them
in safety and in each other&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Having now secured all of the ancient deposit
of wealth that we could carry, we held a solemn
conference to determine our future movements.
The Professor, who had calmed down somewhat
but was still sullen, admitted that with proper
caution we might find our way back to Koser
over the same route by which we had come. The
only puzzling part of the trail was that which
lay through the intricate passes of the Hammemat
mountains, and we were willing to chance
finding the right path because we had no option
but to undertake the risk. From being our guide
Gege-Merak had now become our most dreaded
foe. We were better armed than the chief&rsquo;s
band, and outnumbered it, although three of our
party were only boys. Aside from an ambush
or an unexpected addition to the chief&rsquo;s party
we might hope to hold our own against him
in a declared warfare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>If we could have started at once on our return
journey our chances of reaching the <i>Seagull</i>
in safety might have been better; but it was
necessary for Archie to visit Luxor and deliver
his father&rsquo;s goods to the merchants who had
ordered them, and to receive payment on delivery.
This necessitated a delay which could not
be avoided even under the present trying
circumstances.</p>
<p>Van Dorn assured us that by morning we
could plainly see the outlines of Karnak and
Luxor across the desert, and he said the journey
could be made in three hours. If Archie started
at daybreak he could reach Luxor in time for
breakfast and by concluding his business as soon
as possible ought to be able to rejoin our party
by noon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>But Archie did not relish going alone upon
this mission, and I had grown to like the young
fellow so well that I offered to accompany him.
It was decided all of us should move around the
base of Tel-Ambra, after concealing every trace
of our visit to the pit, and there encamp to await
our return from Luxor.</p>
<p>We had to bury poor Cunningham in the sand;
but we dug him a deep grave and wrapped him
in two blankets in lieu of a proper coffin. The
stone having been dropped to cover the cavity
and the sand piled in and smoothed above it, we
marched across to Tel-Ambra and came to a halt
well on the other side of it. Here we speedily
made camp and appointed Bryonia and Ned
Britton to watch while we lay down to sleep.</p>
<p>I was so excited by the occurrences of the night
that I could not compose myself to slumber for
some time, but lay awake and watched Van
Dorn, who, also restless, paced up and down
in the sands apparently in deep thought. He had
grown moody and unsociable, and since his
violent exhibition of temper I had come to dislike
him more than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>When dawn came creeping over the desert
I sprang up and aroused Archie. The others
were mostly awake, I found, and while we
munched a little food Joe came to me and begged
to travel to Luxor in our company.</p>
<p>Ned Britton, who had now assumed military
command of our party, thought there would
be no greater danger to the others and more
safety to Archie and me if Joe accompanied us;
so Uncle Naboth&rsquo;s consent was obtained and
we three mounted our camels and set off at
a brisk pace toward Luxor, the outlines of which
city the Professor pointed out.</p>
<p>The morning air of the desert was crisp and
invigorating, and so fresh were our camels that
in two and a half hours we reached the Karnak
road and soon after clattered into the streets
of Luxor.</p>
<p>It is an odd town, a mingling of the modern
and ancient. On the bank of the Nile stands the
ruin of the great temple so famous in history,
its many rows of lotus-capped columns rising
toward the sky in magnificent array. Beside the
monster temple is a litter of mud huts; across
the way is the wall surrounding the fine modern
Hotel Luxor, and against this wall on all sides
are rows of booths occupied by the Greek,
Syrian, and Arab merchants as bazars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>When we arrived and inquired for the merchants
with whom Archie was to deal, we found
their shops still closed; so we entered the grounds
of the hotel, left our camels at the stables, hired
a dray to fetch Archie&rsquo;s boxes from the railway
station, and then treated ourselves to a good
breakfast served in civilized fashion. By the
time it was finished the boxes were waiting in
a cart outside, and the merchants, we found, had
arrived at their shops and were anxious to
examine the goods.</p>
<p>We realized the necessity of making haste and
so accepted the invitation of a Syrian dealer
to open our boxes in a big vacant room back
of his bazar. We admitted only the two men
who had ordered the goods, although a group
of curious natives wished to enter with us, and
soon Archie, Joe, and I had the cases open and
the goods spread out for examination.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>The Syrian and his fellow merchant, a gray-bearded
Greek, gravely inspected and approved
the clever imitations of ancient scarabs, charms,
figures, urns, and the like, that had been &ldquo;made
in America&rdquo; to deceive American tourists in
Egypt; but when Archie demanded to be paid
the price agreed upon they both demurred,
claiming the trinkets were not worth the sum
asked.</p>
<p>Archie was indignant and threatened to box
up the goods again and ship them to Cairo; and
then began the inevitable bargaining that is so
tedious but necessary in dealing with the
Egyptians.</p>
<p>While my friend, who proved no unskillful
bargainer, was engaged in this occupation
I chanced to glance toward the one dirty window
in the place and saw a man standing outside who
instantly riveted my attention. He was tall and
stately, with a calm, handsome face and steady
eyes, and while he gazed in upon us it suddenly
flashed across me that I had seen this Arab before&mdash;standing
on the quay at Alexandria and staring
at the <i>Seagull</i> as we had sailed out of the harbor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Yes; it was indeed Abdul Hashim, the Professor&rsquo;s
most bitter enemy; and as this fact was
revealed to me I remembered the peril of our
friends awaiting us on the desert and turned
impatiently to Archie to ask him to hasten.</p>
<p>As I spoke the eyes of the Arab outside turned
toward mine and, perhaps seeing my glance of
recognition, he turned and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Archie,&rdquo; I said in a low voice, &ldquo;for heaven&rsquo;s
sake end this squabbling. Too much depends
on our prompt return to quarrel over a few
beastly piasters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed to realize this, for he quickly closed
with the offers of the merchants and they paid
him the sum he had agreed to take in English
bank notes and gold. While the money was
being counted out I saw Abdul Hashim again
at the window, his greedy eyes feasting upon the
money; and this made me more nervous than
before. I quickly made my way outside and
moved around to the window, but the Arab had
disappeared and I failed to find him in any of the
neighboring streets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>I told Archie and Joe of my discovery, and
that Abdul Hashim had seen us receive the
money. The tale alarmed my friends, but after
a moment&rsquo;s thought Archie decided what to do.
We went at once to Cook&rsquo;s banking office, which
was in the hotel building, and there Archie
exchanged his gold and notes for a draft on the
bank&rsquo;s American correspondents, for the full
amount. The paper he placed in his stocking,
flat on the sole of his foot, and then he drew
on his boot with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is stolen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;no one can cash
it but my father; but I&rsquo;d like to see the Arab
or Bega clever enough to find the draft where
I&rsquo;ve hidden it. Come on, boys; we&rsquo;re free now;
so let&rsquo;s hurry back to our party and the
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The camels had been watered and fed by the
hotel attendants, and we hastened to mount them
and start on our return journey. As we left the
town it was a little after eleven o&rsquo;clock, for much
valuable time had been consumed in settling
Archie&rsquo;s business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s what I came to Egypt for,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;and father would be wild if I neglected the
business he sent me on, even to get a share of that
treasure. As it is I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll think me a poor
hand at a bargain, to take less than was agreed
upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no trusting to the word of these
native merchants,&rdquo; I remarked, as we sped away
over the sands. &ldquo;How much did you manage
to get for that rubbish, Archie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About twenty-five hundred dollars. But
I ought to have had three thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did it cost to make the stuff?&rdquo;
I inquired, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the material is mostly mud, you know;
but the molds and the workmanship are expensive.
With the freight and my own expenses added,
the finished product cost us nearly nine hundred
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad deal, then,&rdquo; said I, with a laugh.
&ldquo;Your father will find himself a bit richer,
anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of what those rascally merchants
will make!&rdquo; he exclaimed indignantly. &ldquo;The
scarabs, which cost them about half a cent each,
they&rsquo;ll sell for twenty piasters&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a
whole dollar!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boys,&rdquo; observed Joe, quietly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
being followed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We turned quickly in our saddles at this
startling news, and a glance told us Joe was
right. Coming toward us in a cloud of dust,
from the direction of Luxor, were several camels
and donkeys. Already they were near enough
for us to see that they were ridden by a band
of Arabs, who were urging the animals to their
best speed.</p>
<p>We pricked up our camels with the sharpened
sticks provided for that purpose, and with groans
of protest the supple beasts threw out their hoofs
and fairly flew over the sands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ABDUL HASHIM EXPLAINS.</span></h2>
<p>Far ahead we could see the outlines of Tel-Ambra
standing clear against the blue sky, and
toward this we headed, for our friends would
be there awaiting us.</p>
<p>Our pursuers also redoubled their pace, and
it became a set race in which only the endurance
of our animals was of importance. The camels
we rode were among the best of Gege-Merak&rsquo;s
herd, and we saw with satisfaction that they
could easily keep the distance between ourselves
and the Arabs.</p>
<p>Gradually the mound grew nearer and we
strained our eyes to discover Uncle Naboth and
his party, who should be near its base. Perhaps
they were on the other side, and had not observed
our approach. The quick pace was beginning
to tell on our camels, which all breathed heavily;
but on we dashed at full speed, for the remaining
distance was short.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>We reached the base of the hill, skirted it
without slacking rein, and then with a sense of
dismay realized that we were alone upon the
desert&mdash;save for that grim and relentless band
following in our wake.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth, the Professor, Ned Britton, the
sailors and Bry&mdash;even the camels with the
treasure&mdash;had all been swallowed up by the
mysterious waste of sands.</p>
<p>And now we three boys, left to our fate, must
show the mettle we were made of. We halted
our panting camels, backed them against a rocky
cliff of Tel-Ambra, and hastily unslung our
repeating rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us be captured without a struggle,
boys,&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fight while there&rsquo;s a bullet left or a
breath in us,&rdquo; responded Archie, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, fellows, if you say so,&rdquo; said Joe,
strapping on his cartridge belt; &ldquo;but it seems
to me you&rsquo;re making a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; I asked, rather indignantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look at them,&rdquo; said Joe. The Arabs had
halted just out of range, but we could count their
numbers now. &ldquo;There are about twenty of the
rascals, and they&rsquo;re all armed. We can&rsquo;t hope
to beat them in a fight. We can kill a few, of
course, but they&rsquo;ll down us in the end. And
what then? Why, they&rsquo;ll be mad as hornets, and
want revenge. It&rsquo;s natural. But as it now stands
we are not the enemies of these heathens, as I can
see, having had no dealings with them. I understand
they want to rob us, for they think we&rsquo;ve
got the money those merchants paid Archie&mdash;that
beast Abdul Hashim is at the head of them. But
if we submit quietly to being searched they won&rsquo;t
find any money and they&rsquo;ll scarcely dare kill
us for disappointing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Archie, eyeing
the foe fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Van Dorn say these
Arabs will kill a Christian as calmly as they&rsquo;ll eat
a dinner. They think a good Mahommedan will
gain paradise by killing an infidel dog. And
besides that, if they try to rob us and then let
us go our ways, they&rsquo;ll be afraid we will make
trouble for them with the police. No, Joe; it&rsquo;s
robbery they mean first, and murder afterward;
you can rely upon that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, sir,&rdquo; answered Joe. &ldquo;But I was
just looking for our one chance. To fight means
sure death; to give in quietly means a hope for
life&mdash;not a great hope, sir, but one just big
enough to hang your hat on. If you say fight,
I&rsquo;m with you. If you say be foxy and try
diplomacy, I&rsquo;ll like it better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said I, partly convinced. &ldquo;Perhaps
Joe&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he is,&rdquo; responded Archie, frankly.
&ldquo;But I hate to see those beggars down us so
easily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discretion is the better part of valor,&rdquo;
I quoted, pompously; yet I longed to fight, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t giving in, fellows,&rdquo; declared Joe;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;re just playing our best cards in the game,
and it isn&rsquo;t our fault if we don&rsquo;t hold all trumps.
Come on; don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s act like cowards, or even
whipped curs. Let&rsquo;s go to meet them&mdash;and, say,
put up your rifles. We won&rsquo;t show any force,
but try to smile and look pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>The Arabs had been conversing together,
evidently trying to decide how to attack us. They
knew if they came within range of our rifles some
of them would be shot down, and since they now
had us safely snared they might take time to
figure out the problem.</p>
<p>Had there been any hope of our overtaking
our friends I should have advised keeping the
Arabs at bay as long as possible. But as far
as the eye could reach, in every direction, the
desert was deserted save by the two groups at
Tel-Ambra. What, I questioned, anxiously,
could have induced my uncle and Ned Britton
to desert us? Such an act was wholly unlike
them, and there must indeed have been a powerful
reason behind it. At present it was all a profound
mystery to us, and we had no time to make
an attempt to unravel the web.</p>
<p>Thinking Joe&rsquo;s counsel good, in the circumstances,
we started our camels and advanced
leisurely toward the Arabs. They were startled
at first, expecting a fight; then, as they saw our
rifles slung over our shoulders, they became
puzzled by our audacity and amazed at our boldness.
But they stood in a motionless group
awaiting our approach, and as we drew near to
them I, being slightly in advance of the other two,
said in a voice which I strove to render calm:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, gentlemen. Can you tell us the
way to the village of Laketa? I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ve
missed the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Arabs looked at us stupidly a moment, and
then Abdul Hashim spurred his donkey&mdash;a
strong, thin limbed beast&mdash;toward me and
touched his turban. His gesture indicated respect,
but his steady eyes were as unfathomable
as a pool at midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blessing of Allah be thine, Effendi,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;What is your errand at Laketa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To rejoin the rest of our party,&rdquo; I answered
confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; your party from the ship, with the
red-bearded jackal Van Dorn at their head,&rdquo;
he said, with a flash of resentment as he mentioned
the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong in one thing,&rdquo; said I, calmly.
&ldquo;Naboth Perkins, my uncle, heads the party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why try to deceive us, Effendi?&rdquo; asked
Abdul Hashim, in a sterner tone. &ldquo;You take
me for a fool, it seems; and a fool I am not.
You would not be here&mdash;you could not be here&mdash;unless
led by the red-beard, who is a dog and
a traitor to his masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t answer for Van Dorn,&rdquo; I replied,
with a shrug. &ldquo;It seems you know the Professor,
and don&rsquo;t like him; but I&rsquo;m sure that is none
of our business. All we ask of you is the favor
of a courteous direction to Laketa. If you will
not give this, we must proceed without it, and
find the place the best way we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had observed that as we conversed the band
of Arabs had crept around our group, slowly
encircling us in all directions, so that now they
fairly hemmed us in. Also their long rifles were
in their hands and their belts were stuck full
of pistols and knives. The party had been formed
for warfare, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Although noting all this I endeavored to
appear unconcerned as I awaited the sheik&rsquo;s
reply.</p>
<p>The latter smiled rather grimly and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;We will indeed be your guides, young sirs;
but not to Laketa. Forgive me if I ask for your
companionship until you have told us all I wish
to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that, Abdul Hashim?&rdquo; I asked
boldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know my name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. We knocked you down that
evening we rescued Van Dorn from your clutches
in Alexandria, and he told us your history. The
Professor wanted us to kill you; but we refused.
Perhaps you remember that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that I owe my life to my own
skill, and not to your mercy.&rdquo; He expressed
himself in excellent English, for an Arab. But
the English have occupied Egypt for so long that
nearly all the natives have learned to speak or at
least understand our language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not told me what it is that you wish
to know,&rdquo; I said, impatiently.</p>
<p>He looked me over with a thoughtful expression
and proceeded to examine each of my
comrades, in turn. Then he said, abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come to my village.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>At once the Arabs began to move forward, and
we, being surrounded, were forced to accompany
them. They were an evil appearing lot, dirty
and hungry looking, and I did not doubt that any
one of them would murder us with much
satisfaction, merely for the pleasure of killing.</p>
<p>As for Abdul Hashim himself, I began to
perceive he was a character, and one worth
studying in other circumstances. Never have
I seen more handsome features on any man, but
they were as immobile as if carved from marble.
Any expression you might read showed in his
eyes, which he could not control so well as he did
his face. Usually they were calm as those of the
sphinx, but at times they flashed evilly&mdash;nay, even
with a gleam of madness in them&mdash;and always
they were cruel and terrible in their aspect. In
civilized countries a man like this would
be greatly dreaded; here he was an insignificant
sheik, with a handful of followers too degraded
to be of any importance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>We passed around Tel-Ambra to the left and
headed for the small group of rude stone huts
which the Professor had sighted the night before
and had aroused in him such violent emotions.
The place was not far distant from the three
ancient palms, and as we rode along I glanced
over the desert to try to discover the spot where
the treasure was hid; but the endless, undulating
sands refused to reveal their secret. Indeed, the
brisk morning breeze appeared to have smoothed
away every trace of our night&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Abdul Hashim said little until we reached his
village, which had hastily been rebuilt after the
police had demolished it. Even before then
it must have been a miserable affair; now it was
scarce worthy the name of village, or suitable for
mortal habitation. Doubtless the only object
of a settlement at this place was to waylay
travelers who crossed the desert from the Red
Sea, and I could conjecture without much chance
of going wrong that robbery had been the only
means of livelihood for its inhabitants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>Entering a narrow street we were told to
dismount in front of the most important hovel the
place contained. We obeyed because we could not
well do otherwise. Abdul Hashim personally
ushered us into the dwelling, and as we entered
the Arabs slily cut the straps of our rifles and
took the weapons from us. We dared not resent
this insult, but though we made no protest in
words we were angry enough when we turned
to face the sheik, who alone had entered with us.</p>
<p>The room consisted of four bare stone walls of
uneven height, only a portion of the inclosed
space being roofed or thatched with palm
branches. Slabs and blocks of stone lay around
in all directions, as if the work of restoring the
walls was still incomplete. In one corner a black
goat with a white spot over one eye lay asleep
in the shade, and a rude bed of palm leaves stood
underneath the thatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; began our captor, in a brusk tone,
&ldquo;let us come to an understanding, if you will. You
<i>gid&acirc;n</i><a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> must tell me all that I wish to know, or I
will put you to sleep forever. But first I will
tell you what I already know. It is this: The
red-bearded jackal you call Van Dorn was
formerly the slave of a wise explorer named
Lovelace Pasha, who was my friend. Lovelace
Pasha sought for buried treasure in the desert,
and I gave him my assistance in return for his
promise to give me and my people a share of the
treasure, if he found where it lay. This Lovelace
was a real effendi&mdash;a gentleman&mdash;and always
to Abdul Hashim a true friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;One night he found the treasure, and with
him at the time were two of my tribe&mdash;one being
my own brother&mdash;and the slave Van Dorn.
Lovelace Pasha took a few jewels and started
to return to my village, but the discovery had
driven Van Dorn mad. He shot my men and
killed them, and would have shot Lovelace
Pasha had he not caught and held the red-beard
and wrenched the pistol from his grasp. So my
friend bound Van Dorn with ropes and brought
him to my village, with the sad news of the crime
he had committed. Also Lovelace Pasha showed
me the jewels which he had taken, and said there
was much treasure to divide and that I should
have my share according to the compact, as I had
been faithful to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;My people, <i>gid&acirc;n</i>, do not take vengeance upon
those whom Allah has smitten with madness;
so we did no harm to Van Dorn. Lovelace Pasha
declared the fellow was without mind or reason,
but offered to care for him until the morning,
as he did not fear him. So he took him into his
house and my village went to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning we found that another great
crime had been committed. Van Dorn had
broken his bonds, stabbed Lovelace Pasha to the
heart, robbed him of the jewels, and escaped to
Luxor. With him he carried the secret of where
the treasure lay hid, and too late we gained the
knowledge that the red-beard was not mad,
as one without reason, but merely mad to gain all
the treasure for himself and willing to kill and
defy all who stood in the way of his gaining the
vast store his master had discovered. For, mark
the cunning of the miserable thief, Effendi: this
Van Dorn told the police that I and my people
had murdered the great Lovelace Pasha, and the
governor, believing him, sent a strong force
to my village and destroyed it, declaring me and
all my tribe outlaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus did the jackal add to his crimes and
prove he was not afflicted of Allah, but by the
devil of the Christians. And, tell me, would
a Christian, even, love him after this?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;I followed him secretly to Alexandria and
with some friends to assist me was about to capture
Van Dorn and make him lead us where the
treasure is hid, when he cried out in fear and
your party came to his rescue. Again he escaped
me, for you took him aboard your ship and sailed
away. I watched you, and feared that my
revenge and the secret of the treasure were both
lost to me. Then I remembered the jackal&rsquo;s
slyness, and knew that some time he would return
to secure the wealth that was hid in the sands
near to my village. So I came home to watch
for him, yet I did not expect him to act so soon.
In Luxor I saw you and recognized the fact that
you belonged to the ship in which Van Dorn had
sailed away. They told me you had ridden your
camels in from the desert, therefore I knew you
had followed the trail from the Red Sea. It was
all plain enough, with a little thought. I got
my men together and followed you, as you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>The sheik paused. He had spoken earnestly
and well, and his story bewildered us because
we had until now believed in the plausible tale
the Professor had told us. If Abdul Hashim&rsquo;s
relation was true the little Professor was indeed
a diabolical scoundrel; and I had a secret conviction
that a part of it, at least, was to be
believed rather than Van Dorn&rsquo;s version. But
was not Abdul Hashim also a scoundrel and
thief? You had but to look at the fellow to doubt
that there was an honest hair in his head.
Privately I decided that neither was entitled to
any share of Lovelace&rsquo;s find; but however the
original discoverer had been done to death a bitter
feud had undoubtedly sprung up between Van
Dorn and the Arab&mdash;both eager to profit by
Lovelace Pasha&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; resumed the sheik, abruptly, &ldquo;where
is your ship&mdash;at Koser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you came over the caravan route
through the mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, then, you know when the jackal
will try to secure the treasure?&rdquo; the sheik continued,
eyeing me intently.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>I decided there was little harm in being frank
with the man. He knew there was a treasure
and that Van Dorn was after it and would not
rest till he got it. So it would avail us nothing
to lie, and I hoped our final safety might result
from being frank and truthful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Van Dorn has already secured the treasure,&rdquo;
I answered.</p>
<p>For the first time the passionate heart of the
man conquered his impassive frame. He gave
a start of dismay and his face was for an instant
contorted with fear and anger. But presently
he controlled himself with a great effort
and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was this, Effendi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, then, is the robber now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know. We went to Luxor on business
and our party was to wait for us at Tel-Ambra.
When we arrived they were gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had reminded him of something. He looked
at Archie and said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>&ldquo;You received some money at Luxor. This
is a dangerous place, so I will myself take care
of your money until you are in safety, or rejoin
your friends. Give it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archie grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re as big a thief as Van Dorn,&rdquo;
he answered, easily. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve fooled you, my
good Arab. The money is now in Cook&rsquo;s bank
at Luxor, and I don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;ll give it up
if you go and ask them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Arab frowned; but perhaps he remembered
there was more important game to be
bagged, for he said no more about Archie&rsquo;s
money, to the boy&rsquo;s great relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did the jackal secure much treasure?&rdquo; he
inquired, turning to me with a trace of eagerness
in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a lot. Enough to load two camels,&rdquo;
I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did any remain after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty, as far as I could judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>&ldquo;I could not find it again if I tried; nor could
my companions. Van Dorn did not tell us how
to get to it. He led us there at night, and it
is still his secret as far as we are concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this Abdul Hashim began to pace nervously
up and down the room, the floor of which
was hard earth. Suddenly he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many people came with you from
Koser?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>I was glad he asked the question that way,
for it gave me an opportunity to answer truthfully
and still mislead him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gege-Merak, who guided us, had an escort
of six Bega warriors; in our party were nine&mdash;fifteen
in all,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gege-Merak!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in an annoyed
tone, and resumed his pacing. Evidently the
news did not please him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>I acknowledge that I hardly knew how to
conduct myself in so strange an emergency. The
question was whether to try to make an ally of
the sheik or to defy him. It naturally worried
me to be separated from my uncle and his party
of Americans, of whose fate I now stood in
doubt. The treasure I believed to be seriously
threatened by Gege-Merak, who had so inopportunely
discovered our secret, and the chief
would have no hesitation in murdering us all if
he found an opportunity. With Abdul Hashim
on our side we might successfully defy Gege-Merak,
yet to set the Arab on the trail meant
sure death to the Professor and a loss of much
of the treasure, since the sheik would be sure
to put forward his claim for a division, under
the alleged compact existing between himself
and Lovelace.</p>
<p>Truly we Americans were in double peril, from
the Bega chief on one side and the Arab sheik on
the other; and how we might extricate ourselves
from the difficulties that beset us was a difficult
problem. If we three boys were again with Ned
and Uncle Naboth we could assist them to fight
it out, but our loss must have weakened them
greatly, and alone we three were well nigh
powerless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen,&rdquo; repeated Abdul Hashim, musingly;
&ldquo;fifteen. Are you Americans true men?&rdquo; he then
inquired, with an appearance of earnestness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True as steel,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will they deliver Van Dorn to my vengeance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question amused me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sheik; they will be true to Van Dorn,
who has been true to them. They do not know
the story you have just told me, and have no
grievance against the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when they learn the truth will they deliver
him up?&rdquo; he persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. My uncle would take an American&rsquo;s
word in preference to that of an Arab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must fight,&rdquo; said Abdul Hashim, as if to
himself. &ldquo;But not openly. I must meet treachery
with treachery. Very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and looked at us with composure,
as if he had settled all difficulties in his own
mind and outlined a plan of action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall yet secure my treasure and my revenge,&rdquo;
he continued, and then bowed low to
us and left the room. The bow was a mockery,
and we felt less assurance in the sheik&rsquo;s absence
than when we faced him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>But here we were, prisoners of an unscrupulous
and lawless Arab, and realizing that any
present attempt to escape would be useless, we
sat down upon the palm branches to await the
next act in the drama.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">PRISONERS.</span></h2>
<p>The situation was not long in developing. A
tall, dirty Arab came in with some coarse food,
which we ate because it was now the middle of
the afternoon and our long ride had made us
hungry.</p>
<p>Scarcely had we finished the meal when more
Arabs came to lead us from our quarters. We
found six camels saddled and kneeling in the
village street. Three were our own, and with
them were three others that seemed equally good&mdash;doubtless
the pick of Abdul Hashim&rsquo;s animals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>The sheik and two stalwart Arabs stood beside
the beasts and, as we approached, Abdul
Hashim tersely commanded us to mount. We
obeyed, selecting our own camels; I ventured to
ask if we could not have our rifles, which I saw
the sheik and his two men holding. The result
was that he not only refused my request, but
ordered us carefully searched, and so our knives
and revolvers were taken away. These the three
coolly appropriated and we were compelled to
mount.</p>
<p>Slowly we rode away from the village toward
the spot where the three aged palms reared
their fronded heads above the sands. Somewhere
near their roots there must have been
moisture, which welled up from below, but never
reached the surface of the desert. It is the only
way to account for the life of these trees amid
the sandy waste, whereon nothing else was able
to grow. Often you meet with such phenomena
in tropical climes&mdash;vegetation existing seemingly
without moisture&mdash;but there must be a rational
explanation of these remarkable occurrences.</p>
<p>Abdul Hashim seemed moody, and a frown
darkened his handsome bronzed features. When
we arrived at the palms he turned to us and
said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have decided to give you a full hour in
which to discover the location of the treasure.
To deny that you know where it lies is useless,
for if you fail to find it you will all three die
here. I will not be burdened with prisoners,
and I dare not set you free; so you may preserve
your lives but in one way, by finding the
treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This foolish speech made me very indignant
with the fellow and discovered the sheik in an
altogether new character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must think we are a bunch of idiots!&rdquo;
I exclaimed, angrily. &ldquo;If you dare not set us
at liberty now, you surely would not dare do so
after we had found the treasure for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may as well kill us now, without farther
trouble,&rdquo; added Archie, gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would be awkward for Abdul
Hashim,&rdquo; observed Joe, with a quiet smile.
&ldquo;Have we not warned the Cadi<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> at Luxor that
we saw the sheik at the window of the bazar,
and that we feared mischief at his hands? And
did not the Cadi promise us that if harm came
to us he would take vengeance on Abdul
Hashim?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>I looked at Joe admiringly. It was all pure
invention, but I could see that the remark impressed
the sheik and caused him to waver in
his purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The death of Abdul Hashim won&rsquo;t help us
after we are murdered,&rdquo; remarked Archie, with
a grin of appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will be a satisfaction, nevertheless, to
our friends,&rdquo; I added, attempting indifference.</p>
<p>Now, the desert Arab is perhaps the most
lawless creature on earth, except the desert Bega;
but also he has a most wholesome fear of the
authorities. The Egyptian mounted police is
considered the finest and ablest body of the kind
in existence, and its officers are merciless in
hunting down the offenders of the law. So the
Arab covers his crimes as much as possible, not
being wholly deterred from them by the police,
but striving in stealthy ways to escape discovery.
Joe&rsquo;s argument was, therefore, the most forcible
one we could have advanced to safeguard our
lives, and we were glad to see that it made our
captor thoughtful. It might not serve, after all,
if the sheik saw any particular object in killing
us off, but until he did the thought of punishment
evidently deterred him from harming us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>He tried another argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, assuming a soft, caressing
tone, &ldquo;there is much treasure left, you say, and
we will divide it equally. Or we will make it
in quarters&mdash;I am not greedy, and a quarter is
enough for one poor Arab like me, who only
wants money to rebuild his village. And afterward
I will escort you and your prize safely to
Koser, or to Cairo, as you may prefer. All will
be well with us, and we shall part friends. Is
it agreed, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was not at all clever, this big and handsome
bandit. No wonder the Professor found
it easy to fool him.</p>
<p>For answer I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you ask is impossible,&rdquo; I said, truly.
&ldquo;Van Dorn has guarded his secret well, for only
he knows where to unearth the treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; declared the sheik, with an abrupt
change in tone, &ldquo;I must have Van Dorn. Come;
let us ride on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you expect to capture Van Dorn&rsquo;s party
with three men?&rdquo; inquired Archie, maliciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I will tell you my plan. I intend to
make a compact with Gege-Merak, if I can overtake
him,&rdquo; was the calm answer. &ldquo;Together we
will get the treasure that has been already taken
and what still remains. We have only to wrest
the secret from the red-bearded jackal, and kill
him. Then we will divide the spoils and each
go our own way. It is simple and easy enough
to do, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to me rather difficult, but I said
nothing. Knowing more of the situation than
Abdul Hashim did, I realized that the Bega
chief was already our secret enemy and would
doubtless be glad to form an alliance with the
Arab, although the Bega professed to despise
the Bedouins who shared the desert with them.
I pinned my faith to Ned Britton, our stalwart
sailors, and Bry, and to the cleverness of the
Professor. Abdul Hashim would find some opposition
in carrying out his &ldquo;easy and simple&rdquo;
plans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>The camels were now sent forward at a swift
pace and soon we reached the miserable oasis
of Laketa. There we learned that all the men
of the village&mdash;some half dozen&mdash;had joined
Gege-Merak&rsquo;s party and gone into the mountains.
The party of Americans had followed
in pursuit an hour later, said an old woman who
spoke English imperfectly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why pursuit?&rdquo; I asked in wonder, when the
sheik, at this information, turned to me with a
triumphant leer.</p>
<p>That, however, the ignorant creature could
not explain, either in her native dialect or in
English. We only knew that friends and foes
had disappeared into the foothills several hours
before, and it puzzled me greatly to understand
why Uncle Naboth had left us three boys to
our fate and started in pursuit of the Bega chief.
The only plausible explanation was that the Professor
wanted to kill Gege-Merak before he could
betray the secret of the treasure and set the authorities
at Koser upon us; but even then it was
unlikely that my uncle would consent to abandon
me and my companions for the sake of the treasure
or to obey Van Dorn&rsquo;s whim. It was not
like the faithful old fellow, who had stood by
me in many a former emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Abdul Hashim did not delay at the village,
but pushed on hastily, late as it was. We three
boys were ordered to ride ahead, and our captors
followed with rifles ready to shoot if we
dared swerve from the path. Neither could we
outdistance them, for their camels were as swift
as our own and more obedient to their control.
So we were as much prisoners as if bound and
manacled.</p>
<p>The twilight is brief in Egypt, so soon after
the setting of the sun we were obliged to make
a halt. We had now reached the old abandoned
well of the Romans, and beside it we made our
camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>First of all the Arabs tethered the camels;
then calmly proceeded to bind us in an original
manner. Our legs were tied from ankles to
knees, and a rope was placed around each of
our necks, looping us together and connecting
us in one string with the most powerful of the
two Arabs who accompanied the sheik. We
were given food and a swallow of tepid water
each, and afterward our wrists were firmly tied
behind us. Trussed up like so many mummies,
we were commanded to lie down and sleep!</p>
<p>Strange to say, we did sleep&mdash;not comfortably,
perhaps, but from extreme fatigue; for the hard
riding of the day had thoroughly exhausted us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE WELL OF THE SCORPIONS.</span></h2>
<p>Next morning I awoke at early dawn to see
Abdul Hashim standing by the curb of the abandoned
well and looking into its depths thoughtfully.
His men joined him a moment later,
and they conversed together in low tones in
Arabic. Several times I heard the word
&ldquo;akareb&rdquo; mentioned, which I knew to signify
scorpions, and at times they would cast a pebble
into the well and then peer after it curiously.</p>
<p>At first I could not imagine what the fellows
were up to. I knew scorpions were thick in
these foothills, and remembered that my friend
Ketti had warned me of them as we passed
through; but why should the Arabs be so interested
in the fact that there were numbers of
these vermin at the bottom of the abandoned
well?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>The sheik soon solved the mystery, to my great
horror. He came to us and kicked us in turn,
bidding us harshly to rise.</p>
<p>Something in the man&rsquo;s eyes warned me of
grave danger. His mood had changed over
night and instead of the thin mask of friendliness
there was now a wicked look on his finely
cut features that I was positive meant our imminent
destruction&mdash;if he could accomplish it.</p>
<p>I slowly and with effort struggled to my feet,
as did Archie and Joe. I braced myself for the
final struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am to reach Gege-Merak I can carry
you with me no longer,&rdquo; announced the sheik,
in a surly tone. &ldquo;Therefore you will have the
misfortune to fall into the well here, and if your
bones are ever found no one can blame me for
your death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The well is full of scorpions, boys,&rdquo; I said
to my companions. &ldquo;The sheik means to murder
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Archie shuddered, Joe remaining strangely
silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a pleasant fate, Abdul Hashim,&rdquo; I
continued, turning to face the scowling Arab.
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you shoot us down, and make an
end of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I fear your friend, the Cadi,&rdquo; he responded,
with a guttural laugh. &ldquo;My plan is
safe for me, and as sure for yourselves. There
shall be no bullet holes in your flesh to trap me;
there shall be no bonds around you to prove
foul play if you are discovered in the well before
the scorpions have picked your bones clean.
Now, then, Hassan&mdash;get to work!&rdquo; he added,
turning with a gesture of command to his tall
follower.</p>
<p>Hassan proceeded to free Joe from his bonds&mdash;he
was first at hand&mdash;and the others at the
same time began to untie our cords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give you a chance to fight the scorpions,&rdquo;
said the sheik, grimly; but that was the
biggest mistake he ever made. He should not
have risked loosening our bonds. He took us
for mere boys, but forgot that even a boy, if he
is an American and desperate, will fight to the
last for life and liberty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>The tall one pushed Joe toward the edge of
the well and was about to thrust him over the
brink when the boy, who had seemed dazed and
inert, suddenly stooped and grasped the Arab&rsquo;s
legs. It was the old trick that had once before
astonished us. There was a brief struggle and
then the man rose into the air, his arms extended
and swinging in space, and plunged head
foremost into the pit. His cry of terror, as he
fell, was bloodcurdling, and Abdul Hashim gave
an answering yell and sprang toward Joe with
a knife glittering in his upraised hand.</p>
<p>Swift as an arrow the boy darted under his
arm and ran where a rifle leaned against the
rock. I saw him swing around and fire point
blank at the sheik, who was not three paces
away&mdash;but I had business of my own to attend
to. For the burly Arab who had partly unfastened
my bonds now clutched me by the
throat and threw me to the ground, where he
knelt on my chest and drew his pistol from his
belt. Just as he fired the weapon was thrust
aside and Archie&rsquo;s big fist crashed into the fellow&rsquo;s
face and knocked him flat beside me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Sam; you can get up now,&rdquo; said
the Yankee, cheerfully. &ldquo;The war&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>He cut my remaining bonds with a knife;
half conscious of what had happened, I sat up
and looked around.</p>
<p>Joe was seated on a rock bandaging his leg
with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a scratch,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Abdul Hashim&rsquo;s
knife grazed me as he fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheik was lying motionless upon his face.
Archie turned him over and the dark eyes stared
steadfastly at the sun, without blinking. I found
myself trembling as with an ague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful, boys!&rdquo; I gasped, appalled by
what we had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; answered Joe, nodding; &ldquo;but it was
our lives against theirs, Sam, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused abruptly, glaring at something behind
me. Archie screamed a warning and I
sprang to my feet to find that the third Arab
had recovered consciousness and was about to
plunge a knife into my back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>I caught his wrist and struggled to hold the
keen blade away from me, but the fellow was
strong as an ox and mad with rage. Archie
came to the rescue and dealt him a couple of
stinging blows, so that he dropped the knife and
caught us both in a fierce embrace, crushing the
two of us against his breast while he dragged
us nearer to the well.</p>
<p>I realized his intention and screamed and
struggled without avail. Nearer and nearer to
the scorpion pit we were dragged until all three
of us, a writhing mass of flesh and muscle, were
tottering on the brink.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i_219.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="741" />
<p class="caption">The fight at the scorpion pit.</p>
</div>
<p>Suddenly a pistol shot cracked&mdash;seemingly
close to my ear&mdash;and the Arab&rsquo;s head dropped.
He gave us one final, spasmodic hug, and partly
relaxed his grasp. I felt that we were all three
reeling into the awful depths below, when my
hair was clutched and I was torn from that
terrible embrace and hurled to the earth. It
was Joe who had saved me, and from where I
lay I saw him straining to save Archie also from
falling into the well. The Arab was either dead
or desperately wounded, but with his final instinct
of enmity he clung to Archie on one side
while Joe dragged at him from the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>The Arab&rsquo;s body, however, was hanging over
the pit, and its weight would soon draw my
struggling, desperate friends after it unless
prompt help was rendered them. I again leaped
up and, half dazed as I was, clung frantically to
Joe, and my added weight gave us the victory.
For the Arab&rsquo;s grasp slackened and his body
slowly collapsed and fell with a thud to the
bottom of the pit, while we three, clinging together
and panting from our efforts, staggered
away to sink weakly upon the ground.</p>
<p>It had all happened in half the time it takes
to tell it, and for a moment the sudden revulsion
from impending death to absolute freedom
was more than we could comprehend. A little
time ago we were being dragged by our terrible
captors to the scorpion pit, there to meet a
frightful death, and now two of our assailants
were themselves in the pit, while the third lay
motionless before us!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; I asked myself, greatly
bewildered; and then I remembered how Joe&rsquo;s
trick at wrestling had tumbled the first man into
the well; how Joe had seized the rifle and shot
Abdul Hashim; how Joe had vanquished the last
Arab by a pistol shot as Archie and I struggled
with him for dear life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>Joe? Yes; Joe had done all this. The quiet,
slender lad I had once befriended through pity
had now saved us all three from an awful fate,
and by his extraordinary pluck and quick wit
had proved himself a hero indeed.</p>
<p>Joe sat before me in an inert heap, breathing
fast after his amazing efforts. Silently I reached
out and grasped both his hands in mine, pressing
them with gratitude too deep for words.
Archie awoke from his stupefied abstraction and
shook our deliverer&rsquo;s hands warmly in his big
paws. But he too forbore to speak. Words
are poor things, and&mdash;Joe understood, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>
<p>Finally we grew calm enough to resume conversation
and to inquire what it was best we
should do next. I was for taking the three best
camels and pushing on toward Koser, hoping
to find the pass through the mountains and regain
the ship. My friends thought the plan as
safe and practical as any. So I arose, rather
unsteadily, for my nerves were still on edge, and
searched the saddle-bags for food, having had
no breakfast. I found plenty of dates, banyans
and dried goat&rsquo;s flesh, and we each took a portion
of these and began to eat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>Presently Archie crawled to the edge of the
well and leaning over looked in. I saw his face
blanch and a look of horror come to his eyes,
but neither Joe nor I asked a single question as
our comrade hastily drew back and came to our
side. Nor have I questioned him since. Whatever
the Yankee boy saw in that gloomy pit he
has never cared to speak of.</p>
<p>We were about to mount our animals, having
recovered our rifles and some of our other
weapons, when the quick tread of approaching
camels reached our ears. Unnerved by our recent
experience, our first impulse was to grasp
our rifles and leap behind a sheltering rock, from
which refuge we might determine whether
friends or foes were drawing near.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">VAN DORN TURNS TRAITOR.</span></h2>
<p>The tread of the camels sounded ahead of us
from up the trail, and soon we were reassured
by a loud voice speaking in hearty American
fashion. Shortly after there moved into our
line of vision Uncle Naboth and Ned Britton,
riding side by side, while after them came
Bryonia and the sailors from the <i>Seagull</i>.</p>
<p>With a shout of joy, we leaped from our concealment,
and my uncle fairly tumbled off his
tall camel in his eagerness to embrace me. It
was indeed a joyful reunion, and for a while
no questions were asked on either side, the satisfaction
of knowing we were all safe and reunited
being enough for us.</p>
<p>But soon the silent form of Abdul Hashim
stretched upon the ground attracted attention,
and Uncle Naboth leaned over it and asked in
a hushed voice:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who killed him, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, uncle; and by killing him saved all our
lives.&rdquo; As quickly and in as few words as possible,
I related the tragic scene just enacted.</p>
<p>But the relation of Abdul Hashim&rsquo;s enmity
reminded me to ask a question, in turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the Professor, uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where&rsquo;s the treasure?&rdquo; demanded
Archie, almost in the same breath.</p>
<p>Uncle Naboth frowned and looked glum, and
Ned swore a deep oath in sailor fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Perfessor, Sam, is a infernal scoundrel!&rdquo;
my uncle answered.</p>
<p>I glanced at the dead Arab. Was his story
indeed true, I wondered, and had Van Dorn
wronged Abdul Hashim even as the sheik had
declared? If so, much might be forgiven the
Arab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us admit the Professor is a scoundrel,&rdquo;
I remarked, &ldquo;for such a statement does not surprise
me. But that does not account for his
absence.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it does,&rdquo; retorted Uncle Naboth; &ldquo;an&rsquo;
it &rsquo;counts for our runnin&rsquo; away and leavin&rsquo; you
boys in the lurch. Almost it accounts for your
all bein&rsquo; killed&mdash;which you would &rsquo;a&rsquo; been, lads,
if it hadn&rsquo;t been fer Joe.&rdquo; Here he glanced
affectionately at our hero, who grew red and
embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;True enough, uncle,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Tell us about
it, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It were this way, Sam,&rdquo; he began, seating
himself upon a stone and mopping his brow with
his red silk handkerchief, for it was hot up here
among the rocks and Mr. Perkins was round
and chubby. &ldquo;You boys hadn&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n started
for Luxor yesterday mornin&rsquo; before that blasted
Gege-Merak come a-ridin&rsquo; up with his band an&rsquo;
all the scoundrelly niggers in the village. They
halted a little way off, for we showed fight an&rsquo;
they was summat afraid of us. But that little
dried-up one-eyed chief was game to come on
alone, an&rsquo; as soon as he was in speakin&rsquo; distance
he begun jabberin&rsquo; away in Arabia to the Perfessor.
Van Dorn answered back, for he can
talk Arabia well enough himself, an&rsquo; so they
jabbered together for a time. I asked &rsquo;em to
speak so&rsquo;s we could understand, for ol&rsquo; Gege
can talk English if he wants to, as you know;
but the Perfessor told me not to interfere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You leave me to deal with him,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll negotiate this business all right. P&rsquo;raps,&rsquo;
says he, &lsquo;the Bega will keep our secret, after all,
an&rsquo; not want a share o&rsquo; the plunder, either. He
ain&rsquo;t lookin&rsquo; for trouble,&rsquo; says the Perfessor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I said nothin&rsquo; more, an&rsquo; they talked an&rsquo;
jabbered a long while. Then on a suddint Van
Dorn turns an&rsquo; says: &lsquo;The chief thinks some o&rsquo;
you understan&rsquo; Arabia, the langwidge as we&rsquo;re
speakin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he suspicions we&rsquo;re a-trappin&rsquo; him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;re all honest English,&rsquo; says I, &rsquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
glad to say we don&rsquo;t know a word of Arabia.
What does he want, anyhow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Perfessor looked hard at Gege, but ol&rsquo;
one-eye wouldn&rsquo;t talk English. &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; says the
Perfessor, &lsquo;state your terms.&rsquo; But still Gege was
silent as a clam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I guess,&rsquo; says the Perfessor, &lsquo;you all better
draw aside an&rsquo; leave me to dicker with the chief.
Draw back a little,&rsquo; says he, motionin&rsquo; to us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, Sam, we&rsquo;d come to rely a
good deal on Van Dorn. He&rsquo;d led us straight
to the treasure, as he&rsquo;d said he would, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;d
sealed it all up accordin&rsquo; to agreement until we
could get it aboard ship an&rsquo; divide it proper.
An&rsquo; we knew we&rsquo;d have a hard time gettin&rsquo;
back to Koser if we had to fight Gege an&rsquo; his
niggers all the way. So we thought if Van Dorn
could settle the trouble in his own fashion we&rsquo;d
give him every chance to do so. Leastwise,
that&rsquo;s what I thought, for I told the boys to
ride off a little way, out o&rsquo; earshot. We did
that, leavin&rsquo; the Perfessor an&rsquo; the chief together,
and leavin&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s where we blundered, my lad&mdash;leavin&rsquo;
the two camels with the treasure with
&rsquo;em. But we hadn&rsquo;t a thought of treachery
until ol&rsquo; Gege raised his arm an&rsquo; the whole troop
o&rsquo; niggers come rushin&rsquo; forward. They surrounded
the Perfessor an&rsquo; the camels, fired a
few shots at us, an&rsquo; then turned an&rsquo; rode as fast
as they could for the village.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ned an&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t know what to do for a
minute. The Perfessor was escapin&rsquo; as lively
as the rest, leadin&rsquo; one treasure camel, while
ol&rsquo; Gege led the other; so we knew well enough
he&rsquo;d put up the job on us an&rsquo; made a dicker with
Gege to rob us of our share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The boys won&rsquo;t be back till afternoon, so
let&rsquo;s foller the thieves an&rsquo; fight it out,&rsquo; says Ned.
That struck me as sensible, so after &rsquo;em we
went, not meanin&rsquo; at the time to desert you, but
tryin&rsquo; to save the treasure we had earned an&rsquo;
to balk the plans of that dum-sizzled Perfessor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did quite right, uncle,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
blame you a bit. Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, lad, they didn&rsquo;t stop at the village, as
we expected, but kep&rsquo; right on. Also we kep&rsquo;
right on. Whenever we got too close they&rsquo;d
turn an&rsquo; shoot at us, but they never hit anything,
an&rsquo; we didn&rsquo;t dare shoot much ourselves
for fear o&rsquo; killin&rsquo; the girl, who was ridin&rsquo; her
camel jest beside the chief an&rsquo; the Perfessor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iva?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She&rsquo;s a pretty girl, Sam, and ain&rsquo;t
to blame in this matter, as I can see; so we
hated to harm her. Another thing, we ain&rsquo;t so
used to shootin&rsquo; folks for a bit o&rsquo; money as these
Arabs is. So all day we chased ol&rsquo; Gege through
the hills, an&rsquo; towards dark we were a long way
ahead o&rsquo; here, past the next stretch o&rsquo; desert
beyond, and well into the black mountains.
Then, to our surprise, instead o&rsquo; keepin&rsquo; in the
trail, the chief and his party turned aside into
a narrer path an&rsquo; rode plumb into a blind ravine,
where they made camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t understan&rsquo; the whys an&rsquo; wherefores
of this, at first, but Ned an&rsquo; I figgered out
that the foxey ol&rsquo; chief, or the Perfessor, or
both, didn&rsquo;t care to get any nearer to Koser
with that treasure while we were hot on their
track. They mean to stop in that canyon until
they can get rid o&rsquo; us, some way or &rsquo;nuther;
for to let us chase &rsquo;em into the settlement, or
to get there first an&rsquo; warn the police, would
mean that they&rsquo;d have to give up the boodle,
sure thing, an&rsquo; p&rsquo;raps render an account for
killin&rsquo; poor Cunningham.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>&ldquo;We watched the mouth of that ravine all
night, but couldn&rsquo;t get any nearer the thieves
&rsquo;cause one man, well armed, can stand in that
narrer place between the rocks an&rsquo; keep off an
army. This mornin&rsquo; we decided we&rsquo;d go back
an&rsquo; find you boys, for you&rsquo;ve been on my mind
a good deal an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve worried about you. So
I&rsquo;m mighty glad to find you so soon, safe an&rsquo;
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This story was as perplexing as it was interesting.
I tried to understand the policy of the
Professor&rsquo;s strange desertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, uncle, do you think Van Dorn preferred
to deal with the Bega chief rather than
remain faithful to us?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s several things to explain it, Sam.
Ol&rsquo; Gege knew the secret, first an&rsquo; foremost, an&rsquo;
the Perfessor reckoned we could never get to
Koser alive an&rsquo; with the treasure as long as the
chief was agin us an&rsquo; hankerin&rsquo; to get his fists
on them jewels an&rsquo; things. Van Dorn had
agreed to give us half of all the treasure, exceptin&rsquo;
the rolls of writin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; if he stuck to his
bargain with us ol&rsquo; Gege might capture the outfit,
bein&rsquo; stronger than we are an&rsquo; knowin&rsquo; the
country better. On the contrary, if Van Dorn
deserted an&rsquo; went over to the chief, he could
make the same terms with him an&rsquo; stand a better
chance of gettin&rsquo; out safe. Mebbe he&rsquo;s got
a plan to return for the rest of the treasure,
an&rsquo; mebbe his idea is to take it to Luxor, so&rsquo;s
to keep out of our way. Anyhow, the Perfessor&rsquo;s
a low-down villain, Sam, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s tryin&rsquo;
to feather his own nest at our expense. I
wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit surprised if he&rsquo;s plottin&rsquo; right
now how to kill us all, so&rsquo;s to make himself safe.
You see, he an&rsquo; Gege has that paper, signed by
us, sayin&rsquo; we don&rsquo;t hold anyone responsible if
we&rsquo;re killed in this adventure. That was a great
mistake, Sam; we hadn&rsquo;t ought to &rsquo;a&rsquo; signed it,
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Van Dorn wouldn&rsquo;t dare go to the ship
and face my father,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. His plan would be to find
some other vessel to carry his plunder away from
Egypt. He&rsquo;s cunning as a weasel, that Perfessor,
an&rsquo; vile as a skunk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>I thought it a good time to relate to our
friends the story of Van Dorn&rsquo;s treachery to
Lovelace Pasha, as told us by the Arab sheik;
and they all agreed that Abdul Hashim&rsquo;s version
was likely to be true, and that the &ldquo;red-beard&rdquo;
had been a scoundrel from the beginning
of his connection with the affair, plotting to get
the treasure away from both the explorer and
the sheik, in case it was discovered. We were
sorry Abdul Hashim had been killed, but his
cold-blooded attempt to murder us had led to
his own undoing, and he was now out of the
running for good and all. The Arab might have
possessed some manly instincts, and perhaps was
a better man than Van Dorn, if the two could
be compared; but his hatred of the white infidels
made him as dangerous as the other, and
we felt that one desperate enemy, at least, had
been removed from our path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he could have lived long enough to
meet the Professor once more,&rdquo; said I, with a
sigh; &ldquo;but fate has robbed the poor devil of
even his revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We buried him among the rocks, to keep the
jackals from preying upon his body, and mounted
our camels to ride toward the place where Gege-Merak
was encamped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>There was little need of haste now. The
chief did not wish to escape us, it seemed, any
more than we wished him to escape. The treasure
was a magnet that drew both parties toward
it irresistibly, and in order to possess it we
must isolate ourselves in these mountains until
we had fought the matter out and one side or
the other became the victor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MAD CAMEL.</span></h2>
<p>Beyond the old Roman well, which had this
morning witnessed so strange a tragedy, there
lay, as you will remember, a stretch of sandy
desert some five miles in extent, beyond which
rose the black breccia cliffs of the Hammemat
Mountains. It was in a rift of these cliffs that
Gege-Merak had established himself.</p>
<p>We were proceeding leisurely across the sands
and had come near enough to the edge of the
mountain to note well its defiles, when our attention
was arrested by a strange occurrence. A
camel came racing at full speed from the hill
path and dashed out upon the flat desert where
we rode. For a short distance the beast made
straight toward us, and we could see a rider
clinging to its back&mdash;a huddled up figure dressed
in a green and scarlet robe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Iva!&rdquo; cried Archie, astonished; and at
the same moment the dress also enabled me to
recognize the chief&rsquo;s granddaughter.</p>
<p>Even as my friend spoke, the camel swerved
and commenced running in a circle, scattering
the sand in clouds as it bounded along in great
leaps. The girl huddled lower, clinging desperately
to her seat as the seemingly infuriated
beast continued on its wild career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the camel&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; I exclaimed, remembering
the tales of mad camels I had heard
related, and seeing in the animal&rsquo;s erratic actions
the solution of the mystery.</p>
<p>There was no doubt of it now. The huge
beast ran here and there in an aimless manner,
never slacking its terrific speed, but darting first
this way and then that, and finally renewing the
circular course that was the clearest proof of
its crazed condition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>Our party had halted involuntarily to watch
the strange scene, but I felt that the girl was
in serious danger and urged my camel forward
without any clear idea of how I could render
her assistance. In a moment I found that Archie
and Joe had both joined me; pricking our animals
to a faster pace we rode straight for the
place where the mad camel was performing his
capricious pranks.</p>
<p>Suddenly the beast stopped&mdash;so abruptly that
Iva flew over its head and landed in the sand
twenty feet or more away. She seemed unhurt
by the fall, for instantly she was on her feet
and, picking up her skirt, ran toward us with
the speed of a deer. At the same time the mad
brute&rsquo;s eye caught the flash of her gaudy robe
and, with a loud bellow, he darted after her
flying figure.</p>
<p>For a second my heart was in my throat.
Then I jabbed the pointed stick into the flank
of my camel and shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, boys&mdash;keep close together and run
the beast down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a desperate act, but Iva&rsquo;s peril was
imminent. Even the lion in his jungle is not
more terrible to face than a mad camel, and in
a few moments the girl might have been trampled
into a shapeless mass by the feet of the
frenzied animal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>Riding so close together that the flanks of the
three camels touched, we dashed swiftly on. Iva
saw us, and, almost as we were upon her, turned
and darted to one side. Her camel had also
marked us, but with elevated head and flashing
eyes, its hoofs spreading in the air as it bounded
along, it made no attempt to pause. Next moment
we came together and struck with the
force of a catapult, the impact being so great
that I sailed skyward and alighted&mdash;fortunately
on my feet&mdash;several yards away. Archie and
Joe also took croppers, and as soon as we recovered
ourselves we looked toward the camels.
They were all in a bunch at first. The mad
one was down, and also one of the others, while
the remaining two were stamping on them with
terrific blows from their powerful feet.</p>
<p>It was a camel fight then, sure enough, for
it is the instinct of these creatures to destroy one
of its kind if it becomes crazed and runs amuck;
and Archie&rsquo;s camel, having tumbled down, would
have suffered severely from the indiscriminate
attack of its companions had it not found a
chance to rise and join them against the real
offender.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>When, finally, the mad one lay crushed and
motionless upon the sands, the others quieted
down and stood meekly awaiting us to come
and remount them.</p>
<p>Meantime Ned Britton, who followed close
behind us, had leaped down and caught up the
terrified girl, and when I looked to see what
had become of her I found her seated upon
Ned&rsquo;s steed with our big mate beside her, while
he strove to quiet her fears and agitation by
smoothing her hair with his rough hand.</p>
<p>Heretofore Iva had been sullen and silent,
keeping by the side of the old chief, her grandfather,
like a shadow and seeming to lack any
interest in her surroundings. But now, as we
gathered around her with sympathetic faces, she
became animated and frank, thanking us very
sweetly and with evident gratitude for coming
to her rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how did it happen, Iva?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Why
did you leave Gege-Merak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew back with a sober look; then, impulsively,
she said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you all, for Ketti says you are
honest and good, and I know my grandfather
to be cruel and wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speech astonished us, but the girl continued,
quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ketti has quarreled with his chief, and he is
in disgrace&mdash;Ketti, who will be chief after my
grandfather dies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he, Iva?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Is Ketti to be the
next chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it is his right,&rdquo; she answered, proudly;
&ldquo;and that is why Gege-Merak hates him. But
Ketti is good, and when he is chief I am to
marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Iva!&rdquo; cried Archie. &ldquo;Ketti is the best
fellow in your gang, to my notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;But go on with
your story, Iva.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>&ldquo;The red-beard offered to give our chief half
the treasure he has found if Gege-Merak will
kill you all. My grandfather has promised to
do so, but the men we brought from Laketa are
cowards and do not dare to kill the Americans,
and we have not enough men to be sure we will
beat you in a fight. So the chief sent me back
to our village to get all of the fighting men of
our tribe and bring them to join him in yonder
valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very pretty plan,&rdquo; remarked Uncle Naboth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was why Ketti quarreled,&rdquo; said the
girl. &ldquo;He said you must not be killed, for if
we injured you the whole tribe would suffer,
and perhaps be destroyed. Ketti does not care
for treasure; he says it makes our people thieves
and jackals; and he wants to live honestly and
in peace, as our forefathers did. There was another
thing, too, Effendi. The chief also plots
to kill Red-beard, now that he is in our power,
and to keep to himself all the treasure. Ketti
told my grandfather that was not right, for we
had given Red-beard our word, and the word
of a Bega chief should be an honest word, and
never false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t hurt the Perfessor to kill him,&rdquo; observed
Uncle Naboth reflectively. &ldquo;The dum-sizzled
scoundrel deserves several kinds of
deaths, as a matter of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<p>Iva did not know how to take this speech,
but, after looking at my uncle in grave protest,
she continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Ketti was disgraced&mdash;he, the bravest of
our tribe!&mdash;and the chief, my grandfather, commanded
me to ride to the village for our warriors,
because I could not fight if you attacked
him, and I knew well the way. He made me
take Sekkat, our swiftest camel, although Sekkat
has been acting strangely for two days.
There is Sekkat,&rdquo; she continued, pointing to the
crushed remains of the beast that had so nearly
destroyed her. &ldquo;No sooner had I ridden out of
the valley where the camp is than I understood
that Sekkat was mad. I tried to turn him, and
he rushed down the path and out upon the desert.
The rest of my story you know, Effendi,
and I thank you again for saving my life. Ketti
also will thank you,&rdquo; she continued, with a proud
look at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Ketti is disgraced,&rdquo; I said, smiling.</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed at this and her brow grew
dark and fierce.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not for long will Ketti bow to any man&rsquo;s
anger!&rdquo; she cried. Looking about us with an
air imperious as that of any queen, she added:
&ldquo;Come with me, brave Am&ecirc;rik&acirc;ni! I will show
you how to save both Ketti and yourselves, even
as you have saved me. More; you shall save
Red-beard and his treasure, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last promise was not necessary, but we
accepted it with the rest, and that right joyously,
as you may imagine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your plan, Iva?&rdquo; I asked, as we
once more put our camels in motion and rode
toward the black cliffs of the mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait; you will see,&rdquo; she replied, setting her
lips firmly together. So much were we impressed
by this girl&rsquo;s courage and frankly avowed friendship
that we followed her lead blindly, questioning
her no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">IVA.</span></h2>
<p>It soon became evident to us that Iva knew
this country intimately. She abandoned the
clearly outlined entrance to the pass through
which we had come on our way from Koser,
and led us around to the less promising cliffs
at the left. An hour&rsquo;s ride brought us to a
ravine we had not before noticed, and silently
we entered this and rode among boulders and
loose stones until the steep rocky sides closed in
on us and we could proceed no farther. Then
we dismounted and picketed our camels. Taking
only our rifles and ammunition with us, we followed
the Bega girl up a dizzy and difficult
path that one would have judged, at first sight,
it was impossible to scale. But Iva, mounting
light as an antelope, seemed sure of her way,
and where she went we could not well hesitate
to follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>The perilous climb brought us to the top of
the cliff&mdash;a rocky ridge, narrow and uneven,
with peaks here and there that shot their points
still farther toward the sky. Presently the girl
paused and looked over the edge, and dropped
lightly into a pocket-like hollow of the inner
cliff&mdash;a place that reminded me of an upper box
in a theatre.</p>
<p>Here, quite protected from observation, we
could look down upon the ravine in which Gege-Merak
and his men were encamped. Just beyond
the pass we could see the two tall warriors
who were guarding its entrance, so we
had approached the ravine from the rear.</p>
<p>The cunning old chief had chosen his retreat
well. On all sides were smooth walls of black
breccia, where not even a mountain goat could
have found a foothold. Only at the entrance
was there any cleft that allowed one to enter or
leave the place. The camels stood grouped at
one end, and the four panniers containing the
treasure of the priests of Karnak had been piled
upon a rocky table and were guarded by one of
Gege-Merak&rsquo;s own men. The ravine was perhaps
eighty feet wide by some three hundred
feet long, and several of the low, spreading
Bedouin tents had been pitched just underneath
the hollow wherein we lay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>The chief and all his company, except the
guards I have mentioned, must have been congregated
under these tents when we arrived at our
point of observation, and for more than an hour
we lay there patiently attentive without seeing
any evidence of life in the camp below. We
supposed that Iva&rsquo;s adventure was unknown to
them, shut in as they were, and doubtless the
chief believed her even then to be speeding
toward his village to bring back reinforcements
of fighting men.</p>
<p>But Gege-Merak had no intention of remaining
idle in the meantime, as we were soon to
observe. For at last the Bega began to stream
out of the chief&rsquo;s tent, and among them came
Van Dorn, his arms bound close to his sides and
a big warrior now leading, now pushing him
along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>The Professor seemed weak and unnerved, for
he stumbled among the loose stones that littered
the way and would have fallen more than once
had not his guard steadied him. His head was
bare and his clothing torn in many places.
Doubtless the fellow had struggled desperately
before he had finally been secured.</p>
<p>They led Van Dorn to the end of the ravine
opposite us and placed him with his back against
the rock. The Bega and the Bisharin from
Laketa, all animated and talking eagerly in their
native tongue, formed a group fifty yards away.
Prominent amongst them we could see the
dwarfed, withered form of the aged chief, and
the stalwart, towering figure of Ketti.</p>
<p>Gege-Merak gave an order and a man stepped
forward and leveled his rifle at the Professor.
Before he could fire, Van Dorn shrieked in terror
and dropped to the ground. They raised
him again, cuffing and shaking him until once
more he stood upright. Yet he trembled visibly.
Again the Bega warrior raised his rifle, but,
answering the victim&rsquo;s pitiful screams, Ketti now
sprang before the man and wrenched away his
weapon, protesting so loudly that his voice
reached even to our high nest on the cliff against
the deed the chief had ordered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>Gege-Merak fairly danced with rage at this
defiance. He gave a command which at first
his men seemed reluctant to execute, but finally
two of them approached Ketti, seized him and
drew him away, binding his arms to his sides.
Iva was frantic at this act, and we had to warn
her several times to be quiet or we should surely
be discovered by those below.</p>
<p>It was while I was busy soothing Iva that I
heard a shot and a cry of agony, and turned in
time to see Van Dorn fall flat upon his face.
Poor fellow, the treasure had cost him his life.
However treacherous he had been in his dealings
with Lovelace, with Abdul Hashim and
with us, his final alliance with old Gege-Merak
had brought him into contact with a nature as
unscrupulous as his own, and the barbaric chief
had evened up all scores by robbing the man of
his ill-gotten wealth and his life at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>But it seemed that Gege-Merak&rsquo;s vengeance
was not yet complete, and we could see from
the tense and strained attitudes of the warriors
that Van Dorn&rsquo;s death was but an incident in
the drama. If, indeed, the chief had cause to
hate Ketti, that young man&rsquo;s rash interference
with his commands had given Gege-Merak the
chance, perhaps long desired, to punish him. It
may be he lived in fear of the handsome fellow
who was destined to succeed him at his death,
for Ketti&rsquo;s popularity with the tribe was indisputable.
Anyway, his orders, now given in a
firm, loud voice, seemed instantly to seal the fate
of Iva&rsquo;s lover.</p>
<p>Bound and helpless as he was, the young man
was led to the spot where Van Dorn had stood
and set with his back against the wall of rock.
But there was no craven spirit in the victim
this time. Proudly the warrior stood facing
his chief, his pose erect, his dark eyes calmly
regarding his destroyer and a slight smile of
scorn curling his lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">248</div>
<p>Gege-Merak shouted his commands, but not
a tribesman moved to obey. Softly Iva reached
out her hand and grasped my repeating rifle,
and I let her take it. She knelt before me, her
brown face rigid, her eyes dark with horror, and
rested the barrel on the ledge of rock before
her. I saw Uncle Naboth and Ned glance at
each other significantly; but they made no move
to interfere.</p>
<p>Again and again the chief shouted his orders,
waving his arms imperiously and stamping his
foot in rage; but the Bega stood stolid and unyielding,
and their Bisharin allies shrank back
and huddled in a frightened group in the rear.</p>
<p>Gege-Merak himself snatched a rifle from a
warrior&rsquo;s hand and swinging around leveled it
full at Ketti. At the same instant Iva&rsquo;s rifle
cracked beside me and I saw the aged chief
totter, drop his weapon and sink slowly to the
earth. A shout went up from the assembled
group below, and with one impulse they turned
their eyes toward us.</p>
<p>And now the girl sprang upon the dizzy ledge
and stood where all might see her figure clearly
outlined against the sky. High above her head
she held the rifle that had slain her wicked grandsire,
and as the Bega recognized her they shouted
again&mdash;joyfully this time&mdash;and waved their
hands to her in full approval of her act.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>I own I was horrified for a moment, remembering
the ties of blood between Iva and Gege-Merak;
but she was a wild, half-civilized child
of the desert, and to her simple mind her lover&rsquo;s
life must be preserved at any cost.</p>
<p>All was eager animation in the ravine. Ketti&rsquo;s
bonds were quickly removed, and the big fellow
waved his thanks to the sweetheart whose courage
had saved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Iva, calmly, as she stepped down
to a safer position beside us. &ldquo;There are only
friends in Ketti&rsquo;s tribe now; let us go to him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">KETTI PROVES A FRIEND.</span></h2>
<p>As hastily as might be we groped our way
down the dangerous pathway to the ground
below the cliffs. There we regained our camels
and made for the desert, around the spur of the
mountain, and so up the regular trail to the
mouth of the ravine.</p>
<p>Ketti was eagerly awaiting us, and as she
saw him Iva quickly rode forward and threw
herself from her camel to crouch with bowed
head before the new chief.</p>
<p>Coming to her side, Ketti raised her gently
and, while we watched with curiosity from one
side and the assembled Bega watched from the
other, the young warrior gravely placed one
hand beneath Iva&rsquo;s chin, palm upward, and the
other hand upon her head, palm down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>This, we learned afterward, was the betrothal
ceremony of the Bega. When a young man
chose his bride he went to her and took her chin
and head between his palms, and thus made
claim to her for all time. None other dared
afterward make advances to the girl, under penalty
of incurring her affianced youth&rsquo;s anger.
Indeed, I was told this was frequently the only
ceremony performed at all, whether of betrothal
or marriage, by many of the tribes, although
there was a form of native wedding that included
various and lengthy rites and involved
much feasting and dancing.</p>
<p>The girl, it seems to me, has not a fair chance
in this custom, for she is not allowed to refuse
a man who so salutes her. It is true a brother
or father may challenge a presumptuous warrior
and fight him to the death, but the girl
herself is helpless.</p>
<p>I am sure Ketti and Iva had an elaborate
wedding ceremony thereafter; but that is not a
part of my story, from which I fear I have
digressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">252</div>
<p>Feeling quite safe with the friendly Ketti, we
had no hesitation in following him and his band
into the ravine, where we dismounted and went
at once to examine the body of Van Dorn. He
was quite dead, having been shot through the
heart, and Ned Britton lifted him and bore him
to one of the low tents, of which Ketti willingly
gave us the use. Gege-Merak&rsquo;s body still lay
upon its face where it had fallen, and to my
surprise none of the natives touched it or even
so much as glanced toward it, so far as I could
see.</p>
<p>In the tent, Ned and one of the sailors searched
Van Dorn&rsquo;s clothing and removed from it the
leathern belt, his rings and watch and a small
note-book. Last they found, sewn into the lining
of his well-worn coat, a package, rather bulky,
though flat, covered with goat-skin, tied and
sewn securely and carefully sealed. These things
I took possession of, and Uncle Naboth and I
went to see Ketti to get permission to bury the
body.</p>
<p>We found the young chief seated on a rock
beside Iva, with whom he was conversing most
earnestly. He smiled at us as we came up, and
said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have made changes, Effendi. I am now
chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I understand, Ketti,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m glad of it. We are friends with the Bega
now, are we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are friends,&rdquo; he announced, gravely.
&ldquo;Gege-Merak was bad, and had no love for you.
He loved treasure better, and killed the Red-beard
to get it all. But Ketti does not want
his brothers&rsquo; wealth. It is enough that you have
paid the Bega to guide and protect you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you will return to us the
treasure?&rdquo; I asked, striving to conceal my astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not Ketti&rsquo;s. It was not Gege-Merak&rsquo;s.
It is yours,&rdquo; he said, simply. &ldquo;My tribe shall
not rob, nor shall they slay their friends. While
I am chief, the Bega who call me master must
be honest and good, and keep the laws the great
Khedive has made. Is it not so, Iva?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is the only way for our tribe to prosper
and grow in strength,&rdquo; she answered, soberly.
&ldquo;Under our great and good Chief Ketti we will
be rich and strong, and our father the Khedive
will call us good children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall say, when you return to Koser,&rdquo;
continued Ketti, regarding us earnestly, &ldquo;that
my tribe was true and honest, and touched not
one jewel of your treasure. You will say that
we guided you straight and protected you from
enemies and thieves and earned your money well.
Is it so, Effendi?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will say that, Ketti,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are also things which you will not
say, Effendi,&rdquo; he continued, with a note of
anxiety in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are they, my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not say my people killed the Red-beard;
for you do not know what killed him.
You will not say where he is gone, for that you
do not know. Is not the land broad for men
to wander in? And if any asks you about Gege-Merak
you will be sorrowful and tell how he
died in the desert, being old and feeble, and you
will say that Ketti succeeded him as chief of
the tribe. Then you will mount the great ship
that awaits you and sail away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">255</div>
<p>I began to understand. Ketti intended to
make a bargain with us. He feared the consequences
of the murder of Van Dorn and did not
want the fact that Iva had shot her grandfather
known. If we would promise to be discreet in
these matters he would restore to us the treasure,
which he considered another element of danger
to him, not realizing that we were slyly removing
it in defiance of the Khedive&rsquo;s orders. Had he
known that&mdash;but, fortunately, he did not know it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be as you say, Chief Ketti,&rdquo; I returned;
&ldquo;for we wish you and Iva only happiness,
and to tell some things might cause you
trouble. If your father the Khedive asks us of
your service, we will say you are a good chief,
and faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That pleased him greatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The treasure is untouched,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Not
a seal is broken. It awaits your orders, Effendi.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>Willingly he gave us permission to bury the
Professor among the rocks, which we did during
the afternoon. When we returned to the
ravine from this labor we were surprised to notice
that in our absence the natives had gathered
several heaps of stones, which were piled in the
form of a wide circle around Gege-Merak&rsquo;s body.
But the body itself had not been disturbed, and
the Bega were now lounging in various parts of
the ravine and conversing together in their customary
indifferent manner.</p>
<p>Ketti came to us with the information that
we should start at dawn next morning for Koser,
which he hoped to reach in two days&rsquo; fast riding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will you do with Gege-Merak?&rdquo; I
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His ceremony of entombment will be held
this evening, Effendi. Your people will be welcome
to watch the solemn rites,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>We had supper and awaited with curiosity to
witness the proposed ceremony; but the natives
were in no hurry, and showed no activity until
the stars were bright in the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">257</div>
<p>At a word from Ketti, every Bega and Bisharin
sprang up and stood in a circle around the
dead chief&rsquo;s body. Beginning a low chant they
now commenced to move slowly around Gege-Merak,
keeping step to the chant and bending
in lithe, rhythmic attitudes characteristic of the
Eastern dances. And ever the chorus grew
louder and faster until it became a roar and at
last a wild shout. Also the excitement of the
warriors increased until presently they were
dancing with frenzied leaps.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as they circled round just beside the
piles of rock, each man seized a stone from the
nearest heap and hurled it at the dead body.
From the next pile he grabbed another stone,
until the missiles were raining upon Gege-Merak&rsquo;s
prostrate form from every direction. As the
dance reached its climax of animation and the
shower of rock continued, the old chief&rsquo;s body
began to disappear from sight, until he was
covered up entirely and entombed in a mound
of stone several feet in height.</p>
<p>It was a shocking sight, and seemed to us
extremely brutal; but Iva, who stood by our
side, calmly declared it was the custom of her
people, and that a chief was highly honored who
was thus buried by his people where he fell or
expired. The chant, she told us, was a relation
of his virtues and his mighty deeds on earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>If a chief dies or is killed on the desert, his
people cast sand upon him, in like manner, and
afterward weight the mound with rocks; and,
as his body is never moved from the spot where
he expired, they take down his tent or house
after the funeral and set up the habitation in
another place, leaving his burial mound stationary.</p>
<p>The wild chant rang in my ears long after
the grim ceremony was completed and the camp
had become quiet for the night. We Americans
slept uneasily through the next few hours and
at dawn awoke to eat a hasty breakfast and
mount our camels.</p>
<p>The panniers were replaced on the two extra
animals by Ned and Bryonia, who now took
charge of the treasure. We were pleased to
observe the truth of Ketti&rsquo;s statement that the
wax upon the buckles of the panniers had not
been tampered with and was still intact.</p>
<p>The Bisharin left us here and went away to
their village, and without incident we traversed
the trail back to Koser, which we reached, weary
but exultant, at the close of the second day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>My father and a number of sailors, apprised
by a swift messenger of our coming, were at
the wooden dock to meet us, and we unstrapped
the four treasure-laden panniers from the saddles
of the camels and sent them on board by a
boat commanded by Ned in person.</p>
<p>Captain Steel produced the hundred and eighty
pounds due to Ketti for his services, according
to the contract we had made with Gege-Merak,
and I asked that an extra gold piece be given
to each of the Bega warriors, which was willingly
agreed to since we had been successful in
our quest. It made the simple fellows very happy
indeed.</p>
<p>After consulting with Uncle Naboth and gaining
his consent, I opened the Professor&rsquo;s leathern
belt and took from it the prettiest jewel it contained,
a diadem of yellow gold set with clusters
of pearls and sapphires. This I presented to
Iva as a wedding present from her American
friends, and the beautiful girl was proud indeed
of the gift, as well she might be. Once, perhaps,
it had adorned the brow of some famous
Egyptian queen, and though it might now appear
incongruous upon the person of a poor
Bega woman, we were so grateful to Iva for
the service she had rendered us that we thought
it none too good to express our appreciation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>We parted from Ketti and his people in the
mostly friendly manner, and he returned that
night to his village in the desert.</p>
<p>It was not so easy to get rid of the bearded
Arab sheik of Koser, who was curious to know
what we had brought from Luxor and what
adventures we had met on the way. It was
strange, he added, that the Bega had brought
us safe back again; it was not like that clever,
evil old Gege-Merak. Fortunately no one had
told him of the old chief&rsquo;s death, or he would
have been still more curious.</p>
<p>But we refused to satisfy the fellow&rsquo;s desire
to gossip and kept our mouths fast shut when
he was around. Also we refused his polite offers
of entertainment and to his disgust hoisted sail
early the next morning and head up the gulf
toward Port Ibrahim.</p>
<p>Now that we had the treasure safe aboard,
every moment we delayed was fraught with
danger, and the doubtful friendship of this sheik
of Koser was no longer of any value to us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIX.</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">LOVELACE PASHA.</span></h2>
<p>The treasure was taken from the panniers and,
still snugly packed in the canvas sacks which
Van Dorn had so carefully sealed, carried to
my stateroom and dumped unceremoniously into
a huge chest.</p>
<p>After a brief conference we had decided to
leave it untouched until after we had passed
through the Suez Canal and, free from the shores
of Egypt, were safe on the broad waters of
the Mediterranean. Then we would open the
sacks, sort and examine the treasure, and divide
it in ways still to be agreed upon. Our contract
with Van Dorn, you will remember, gave us his
share in case of his death.</p>
<p>And now, while we sailed up the long branch
of the Red Sea which is called the Arabian Gulf,
I examined with some curiosity the things Ned
had taken from the Professor&rsquo;s dead body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>His note book had been a sort of diary, but
from it several leaves had been torn, as if he
had recorded events which he afterward feared
might compromise him, and had thus destroyed
their written evidence. From what remained I
gathered that the man was no &ldquo;professor&rdquo; at all,
but a wandering adventurer attracted to Egypt
by the recent valuable discoveries there. Falling
in with Lovelace, he had hired his services to
that savant to assist his search, and from scattered
notations in the book I formed the shrewd
conclusion that the fellow had never possessed
the shadow of a claim to Lovelace&rsquo;s discovery.
Abdul Hashim had read his character fairly well,
and it seemed that Van Dorn had played a desperate
and murderous game to win the treasure
for himself and rob, incidentally, the real discoverer
and any others who might lay claim to
a portion of the buried wealth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>Turning from the note book, I cut the stitches
of the goatskin cover of the parcel which Van
Dorn had so cleverly concealed in the lining of
his coat, and proceeded to break the seals, which
I observed bore the monogram &ldquo;J. L.,&rdquo; surmounted
by a winged sphinx. This was not
Van Dorn&rsquo;s seal, but that of Lovelace Pasha,
and I judged that after the owner had sewn and
sealed the packet it had in some way come into
the possession of Van Dorn, who had never yet
ventured to open it.</p>
<p>At this time all of those most interested were
gathered with me in the Captain&rsquo;s room: Uncle
Naboth, Ned, Archie and Joe, as well as my
father. When I removed the covering a small
locket dropped out, and this I opened to glance
at a sweet, womanly face that met my gaze.</p>
<p>Over my shoulder came a sob and a cry and
Joe seized the locket from my hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother!&rdquo; he said, softly, as he devoured
the miniature with eager, loving eyes.</p>
<p>We looked at the boy in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mother, Joe?&rdquo; I questioned, stupidly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>He swiftly drew from beneath his clothing
the slender chain which I had often observed he
wore around his neck, and showed us a similar
locket attached to it. Opening this with trembling
fingers, the boy laid the lockets side by
side, and we saw that the portraits were nearly
identical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father and I each had one,&rdquo; he said, in an
awed whisper; &ldquo;mother has often told me that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know what became of your
father, Joe?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he went away when I was a baby, and
we never heard of him again. For that reason
mother was sure he was dead, for she said he
loved her and would not otherwise have deserted
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, softly, &ldquo;you are about to discover
your father, Joe; for the man who wrote
this and owned the locket could be none other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrote what?&rdquo; asked Uncle Naboth.</p>
<p>I had been hastily examining a flat book which
accompanied the locket. It had leaves of coarse
paper closely covered with writing in a fine,
scholarly hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a manuscript which I believe I will
read aloud,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;It may be interesting to
us, in view of our recent adventure, and I am
sure it will tell Joe something about his father.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>As I spoke I turned over the pages to the end,
and Uncle Naboth, peering over my shoulder,
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s signed by John Lovelace. That
must be the same Lovelace Pasha who discovered
the treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was not a Pasha,&rdquo; I returned, &ldquo;although
he was called so. He was not even entitled to
the name of Lovelace, for here he tells us who
he really was&mdash;John Herring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe was staring intently, first at the lockets
and then at me. His face was pale and his dark
eyes glowed with nervous excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, uncle,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and let me read
what is here written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All now assumed attentive attitudes while I
proceeded to read as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This shall be, to any who reads it after my
death, my last testament and my final behest.
For some weeks I, John Herring, have feared
treachery and sudden death, although I cannot
discover from what direction the danger threatens.
So I am determined to explain herein my
position in Egypt, for, being reserved by nature,
I know that at present I am a mystery to all with
whom I have come into contact in this ancient
and romantic land.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">266</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I am an American, a native of Galveston,
and a graduate of Harvard. Soon after I left
college my father, who was reputed a wealthy
man, died without estate, and I was thrown upon
my own resources. Being little fitted for a business
career I gained scant success, except that I
took a wife to share my poverty&mdash;a gentle natured
woman who gave me devotion and love
but was unable to further my fortunes because
her nature was weaker than my own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was led into an illegitimate venture by
a friend named Jos&eacute; Marrow, an enterprising
Mexican who owned a sloop and proposed that
I join him in smuggling laces and cigars from
Mexico into the United States. We succeeded
for a time and I made considerable money. But
at length I was discovered, as was inevitable, and
only saved myself from imprisonment by sudden
escape. Marrow managed to get me aboard a
vessel bound for Gibraltar and I was obliged to
leave my wife and baby boy without the comfort
of a farewell, although I sent them all the money
I had and my friend Marrow promised to see
they were provided for in case I was unable to
send them more before it was gone. But I thank
God I have been able to supply their wants, and
each year I have sent a substantial remittance to
them through Marrow, who by good fortune was
never suspected of being implicated in the smuggling.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<p>&ldquo;But we never got a dollar!&rdquo; broke in Joe,
indignantly. &ldquo;Old Marrow must have kept
every penny of the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying to this I continued to read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Twelve years ago I made my way to Egypt,
and having been a student of Egyptology in my
college days, I became much interested in the
excavations being made to secure ancient relics.
Soon I was myself successfully engaged in this
search, and I have had the good fortune to discover
several important tombs of the Twenty-fourth
Dynasty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This success finally led to my undertaking
a queer and seemingly impossible search&mdash;for the
treasure hidden by the High Priest Amana of
Karnak at the time of Cambyses&rsquo; invasion. I
conceived the idea that the treasure had been
buried in the sands of the desert, instead of in
the Sacred Lake, according to popular tradition.
For several years I searched the desert around
Karnak without result, and just as I was beginning
to despair I came upon an inscription graven
upon an angle of the ruined walls of the temple
of Seti, which described&mdash;although not accurately&mdash;the
place where the treasure had been
hidden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I must explain that this treasure of Karnak
is mainly a library of papyri recounting the history
of the Egyptians during the period between
the Sixth and Twelfth Dynasties. As no other
records of this period exist our historians have
been in the dark concerning this broad epoch,
although we know from inscriptions found at
Abydos and Edfu that the papyrus rolls hidden
by the priest of Karnak gave a full account of
that portion of Egyptian history which we have
hitherto been unable to account for. So the discovery
of this library means fame and riches to
one fortunate enough to find it, and it is supposed
that a store of gold and precious jewels
was buried by the priests at the same time, which
should further enrich the discoverer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have an explorer&rsquo;s and excavator&rsquo;s license
granted me by the Khedive under the name of
John Lovelace, which name I assumed on coming
to Egypt, although, as I have said, my real name
is John Herring. It was necessary to cover my
identity in this way to avoid extradition in case
the American customs officers discovered my retreat.
But my crime was not an important one
and I believe it has long since been forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The finding of the Karnak treasure is now
merely a question of time, since I know by the
secret inscription where to search for it. But I
found that I needed help, and engaged a man
named Van Dorn, who has at one time been a
foreman at the workings of the Italian excavators
in the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes, to
assist me. He has now been with me nearly
three years, receiving 400 piasters a month, which
is equal to about 20 American dollars. He is a
faithful worker, but has a covetous and dishonest
mind, so that I suspect he will not be trustworthy
in case I discover the treasure. Unfortunately
I have been obliged to intrust him with knowledge
nearly equal to my own, and the misgivings
I have expressed at the beginning of this testament
are mostly due to this man&rsquo;s connection
with my search. I fear the day when the treasure
is at last unearthed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Besides Peter Van Dorn, who is to receive
one thousand dollars, in addition to his wage, if
the treasure is found, I have employed members
of an Arab desert tribe led by one Abdul Hashim,
which inhabits a village near Tel-Ambra.
For his services the sheik Abdul Hashim is also
to receive one thousand dollars when I find the
treasure, but nothing if I am unsuccessful. My
contract with the sheik, to be exact, is for 200
pounds Egyptian. My permit from the Khedive
obliges me to sell the papyri to the Cairo Museum
for a sum not less than the total of my expenses
during the search for them, and should there be
other treasure of gold or jewels, one-half belongs
to the Khedive and the other half to me. This
I write plainly to explain all just claims against
the treasure, should I succeed in finding it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>Here the writing halted, but under date of
January 11, 190&mdash;, it continued as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;At last the search for the treasure of Karnak
has been successful. Last night Van Dorn
and I located a granite slab in which are set three
bronze rings&mdash;evidence indisputable that here lies
the wealth hidden centuries ago to escape the
rapacity of Cambyses. To-night we are to take
two Arabs of Abdul Hashim&rsquo;s tribe to assist
us in lifting the slab, which Van Dorn and I
were unable to do alone. I am eager to see what
lies beneath it. Van Dorn has been acting more
suspiciously than ever this morning, and is in a
state of wild excitement. Perhaps that is natural,
and I do not see how he can rob me of either
the honor of the discovery or of the treasure
itself; but I shall watch him closely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Some months ago I wrote to Jos&eacute; Marrow,
my friend in Galveston, who now commands a
trading ship, stating that I expected shortly to
find a large treasure, and that if I succeeded I
would send all of my share to him to be applied
to the education and advancement in life of my
son, who is now nearly fifteen years of age.
Marrow has written me that my wife is ill and
needs more money than I have sent; but I am
now sure of being able to provide generously for
my family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If anything happens to me to prevent my
carrying out this plan, I implore whoever may
come into possession of this writing as a matter
of simple humanity and justice to fulfill my
wishes and send my share of the proceeds of the
treasure to Capt. Jos&eacute; Marrow, at Galveston,
Texas, U. S. A., to be applied by him for the sole
welfare of my wife and son. And I ask his
Gracious Highness, the Khedive, if by chance
this should come to his notice, to order my estate
disposed of as I have said above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I shall seal and otherwise protect this manuscript
from prying eyes, and it may be that my
fears are fanciful and unfounded, and that I
shall myself have the delight of enriching my
dear ones in person. I wish nothing for myself.
The honor to my name as the discoverer of the
historic papyri of Karnak will be a sufficient
reward.</p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="sc">John Lovelace.</span>&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Uncle Naboth; &ldquo;is that all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all, sir,&rdquo; I answered, closing the book.
&ldquo;But it explains a lot that we did not know, and
transfers the ownership of the treasure from us
to Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all sat thoughtfully considering this for
a time. Then Joe said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have a sort of claim to my father&rsquo;s
share, although that is not quite clear. But the
half that was to go to the Khedive you people
are now fully entitled to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">274</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sure thing,&rdquo; observed Archie, whose
keen Yankee wit had grasped the situation
quicker than mine did. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s consider another
thing, my friends. We agreed long ago
that the hidden treasure of those old priests
belonged by right to whoever was lucky enough
to grab it. It isn&rsquo;t the Khedive&rsquo;s, and never has
been. Lovelace&mdash;or Joe&rsquo;s father&mdash;may have
made a deal with the Khedive to insure his own
safety, but Lovelace did nothing more than to
locate the place where the treasure lay. He
never got his fists on it. Neither did Abdul
Hashim, nor Van Dorn, nor old Gege-Merak,
although any one of &rsquo;em would have seized it if
he could and held on to it like grim death to a
grasshopper. The fact is, we got possession of
the treasure ourselves, at considerable risk, and
it belongs to us except for the liens Joe&rsquo;s father
had on it. In my opinion we needn&rsquo;t consider
the Khedive any more than the Shah of Persia
or any other hungry shark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Uncle Naboth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
keep half an&rsquo; give Joe half. That&rsquo;s fair, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But first,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get safely away from
Egypt,&rdquo; and I left them and went on deck to find
we had just sighted Suez.</p>

<p>We reached Port Said without interruption at
five o&rsquo;clock on a gloomy afternoon, and my father
managed to get his papers signed so he could
clear the port an hour later.</p>
<p>We had used our steam to make the journey
through the Canal, and so we determined to
steam for the next twelve hours, at least, in order
to show our heel to Egypt as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Heading slowly down the harbor we were surprised
at being hailed by a small government
launch flying the Egyptian flag, which pressed
close to our side, while an officer in uniform stood
up and gesticulated wildly toward us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo; asked Captain Steele, leaning
over the rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Wait!&rdquo; cried the fat officer, brokenly.
&ldquo;I must come on board.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hike along, then,&rdquo; called my father, but made
no signal to stop the engines.</p>
<p>We were moving very slowly, for we had
to steer clear of the numerous craft anchored
in the harbor, so the launch grappled our side
and Ned let down a ladder which the official
clutched and swarmed overboard with surprising
agility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Go back!&rdquo; he shouted, as soon as
he reached the deck. &ldquo;This ship is the ship
<i>Seagull</i>; it is arrest&mdash;you are all arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have instruction from his Excellency the
Minister of Finance to stop you. You must
not leave Egypt, he say. You have treasure
on board&mdash;treasure contraband to the Egyptian
Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stared at one another aghast. How in
the world had this information come to the ears
of the government? and what should we do&mdash;what
<i>could</i> we do&mdash;in this emergency? Arrest
and confiscation first, and a legal battle to
follow! We shuddered even to contemplate
such a difficulty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">277</div>
<p>&ldquo;Crowd on full steam, Tomlinson,&rdquo; said Captain
Steele to the Chief Engineer, who stood
beside him. The man saluted with a smile and
retired to obey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for you,&rdquo; continued my father, turning to
the officer, &ldquo;I advise you to get back to your boat
in double quick time. We&rsquo;ve got our papers, in
reg&rsquo;lar fashion, and we&rsquo;re free American citizens.
You can&rsquo;t arrest us a single minute&mdash;you or
your whole blamed Egyptian outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I command! You are under my arrest!
You are criminal!&rdquo; screamed the fat man, stubbornly.
&ldquo;In the name of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of Sam Hill, throw the cuss overboard!&rdquo;
roared the Captain, losing all patience.</p>
<p>To my horror Ned promptly obeyed and the
pompous official tumbled over the rail head first
and disappeared with a splash in the water below.</p>
<p>Those in the launch shouted excitedly and let
go our side to rescue their superior. He bobbed
up a minute later and they grabbed him with a
boat-hook and drew him, dripping and gasping,
aboard their boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<p>But it was too late for them to board us again.
Our propeller was by this time whirling rapidly
and churning the water into a creamy streak in
our wake. Slowly we drew away from the
government boat, which puffed after us at its best
gait, the inmates shaking their fists at us threateningly
but in vain. Presently we lost sight of
them altogether in the gloom, for twilight was
fast falling.</p>
<p>Out into the blue waters of the great Mediterranean
we sped and I for one greeted the expanse
gratefully. We had narrowly escaped a
serious disaster, for if the Khedive had once
gripped our hard-won treasure we should never
have set eyes on it again. Also we might have
found ourselves and our ship hopelessly compromised
in the meshes of Egyptian law.</p>
<p>We headed for the southwest point of the
island of Sicily, for we dared not undertake to
pass the straits of Messina. This way would
also bring us sooner to Gibraltar, and we determined
to head our course between Tunis and Sicily,
out of the beaten path of ships, and to keep
away from any port until we were afloat on the
broad Atlantic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>All night our engines throbbed powerfully and
we sped swiftly on our course. By morning we
began to feel we were out of danger, and at
breakfast I decided that during the forenoon we
would open the canvas sacks and take a good look
at our treasure. But while we still sat at table
the mate came down with a grave face to report
that a man-o&rsquo;-war had just been sighted and was
bearing down on us.</p>
<p>We rushed eagerly on deck to inspect the boat
through our glasses and made her out easily
enough. She was a big armored cruiser, heavily
armed, and seemed intent on heading us off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we may be more scared than hurt,&rdquo; remarked
my father, calmly. &ldquo;All nations have
men-o&rsquo;-war in these waters, and it ain&rsquo;t a bit
strange we should run across one. Like as not
she won&rsquo;t mind us at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the course she&rsquo;s headed won&rsquo;t take her to
any port in creation,&rdquo; observed Ned, shaking his
head dolefully. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s after the <i>Seagull</i>, sure
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
<p>It really looked that way, and we stood with
bated breath and watched the huge hulk come on.
It would be folly to try to run away; still we did
not pause an instant.</p>
<p>In an hour she was less than a mile to leeward,
and soon we saw a puff of smoke followed by a
shot that flew singing across our bow. At the
same time she hoisted her flag peak and Ned took
a look at it through his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egypt,&rdquo; he said, laconically, and my heart
sank like a chunk of lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jig&rsquo;s up, fellows,&rdquo; I said, mournfully.
&ldquo;Joe, my lad, you&rsquo;ve been rich for nearly a whole
day. To-night you&rsquo;ll be a pauper again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe grinned, but not with a pleasant expression,
and turned away to vanish below deck. I
was really sorry for the poor chap&mdash;and sorry
for ourselves, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Archie, consolingly;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun, anyhow. The Khedive
can&rsquo;t rob us of that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>As Captain Steele hesitated to obey the first
shot a second one quickly followed, and this came
so near to piercing the hull of his beloved <i>Seagull</i>
that my father uttered a gruff explanation and
ordered Ned to lay to. The engines were stopped
and slowly we lost way and floated quietly upon
the sea, which was smooth as a mill-pond. The
sky was overcast with a mantle of solid gray and
not a breath of wind was stirring.</p>
<p>Had we not been so preoccupied with other
matters I am sure we would ere this have been
speculating on the queer atmospheric conditions
that prevailed, and wondering what they might
portend.</p>
<p>The cruiser slowed up near by and lowered a
gig, which was speedily manned. Then, being
rowed with admirable precision, it shot across
the space which separated us and came alongside.
We threw out a boarding ladder and two officers
climbed it and a minute later stood upon
our deck, where they inquired courteously for
the Captain. They were fine-looking fellows,
middle-aged and with an air of breeding. Their
duty, whatever it might be, would doubtless be
performed in a gentlemanly manner.</p>
<p>My father advanced to announce that he commanded
the <i>Seagull</i> and would be glad to know
by what authority he was arrested on the high
seas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>Said the elder of the two: &ldquo;You resisted an
officer of the Egyptian government in the harbor
of Port Said, and escaped. We consider
you still our prisoner, although you have fled
into neutral waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My papers are regular, sir, and you have
no right to arrest me or to fire upon my ship,&rdquo;
returned my father, boldly. &ldquo;If you persist in
your illegal and high-handed course, sir, you will
make this an international affair,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is little danger of that, Captain Steele,&rdquo;
answered the officer, with a smile. &ldquo;It may be
we have exceeded our authority in arresting
you here; but kindly permit me to state our case.
In Egypt you dug up a treasure&mdash;an important
treasure&mdash;which you are now carrying away in
defiance of our laws. We should not have permitted
your ship to clear our port, I admit, but
unfortunately we did not receive the news of
your misdemeanor in time to prevent by force
your escape. However, we do not intend to
be robbed. Our instructions from the Minister
of War at Cairo are positive. We are told to
recover the treasure or send your ship to the
bottom of the sea&mdash;or to do both, at our discretion.
The matter of legality we will not discuss.
We have the power to take this treasure if you
refuse to give it up cheerfully, and I assure you
we will do so. That is all. I await your decision,
Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>Well, there was nothing for us to do but give
up the treasure. If we tried to withhold it we
would lose both the treasure and the <i>Seagull</i>.
We held a short conference, however, Uncle
Naboth, Ned and Archie being present besides
my father and myself. Joe was also an interested
partner, but was not on deck and we had
no time to hunt him up.</p>
<p>We decided there was but one way out of our
difficulty. The American government would
scarcely support us in a claim for damages, under
such peculiar circumstances; and this the clever
Turks knew as well as we did.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>The thing that most amazed us was the accuracy
of their information, and we wondered who
could have revealed to the government the fact
that we had secured the treasure. Abdul Hashim
was dead, but some of his tribe might have
learned our secret and reported it to the authorities
in order to obtain vengeance for their sheik&rsquo;s
death. Or the villagers of Laketa, who had seen
the treasure in Gege-Merak&rsquo;s possession, might
have disclosed the information. We did not
suspect Ketti for a moment.</p>
<p>Anyway, the mischief was out and it only
remained for us to give up the treasure and
make our way homeward somewhat the poorer
for our unsuccessful enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, gentlemen, if I ask you to make
haste,&rdquo; said one of the Turkish officers, stepping
to our side. &ldquo;The simoon is threatening both
our ships, so we are anxious to finish our errand
and be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the day had grown suddenly darker
and the sea sighed audibly, although it was perfectly
still. My father looked anxiously at his
bare rigging and hurried away to give an order
for additional security. Ned followed him, and
Uncle Naboth turned to me and said, with almost
a groan:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give &rsquo;em the treasure, Sam, an&rsquo; let&rsquo;s be done
with the blamed Egyptians forever.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>I bowed to the officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will come below you shall have it,&rdquo; I
said; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;d better get a couple of your
men to help carry it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to the side and shouted an order,
and two of the men from the gig sprang on
deck. I took them to my stateroom, threw open
the lid of the great chest and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, gentlemen, is the entire treasure,
including the rolls of papyrus. If you doubt
that it is all here, you are welcome to search
the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lugged it all away and I sighed to think
we had never obtained so much as one good
view of the plunder we had been at so much
pains to gain. The canvas sacks still bore the
original seals which Van Dorn had placed upon
them in the desert beside the pit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>When the last sack was in the boat they did
delay to search the ship, to my extreme disgust.
But their search was hasty and perfunctory, and
after visiting the other cabins and peering into
the forecastle and galley&mdash;as if we would keep
treasure hidden in such places!&mdash;they finally got
into the gig to return to their ship. I demanded
a receipt, but they refused to give one, mumbling
that the threatening simoon was likely to
strike us any minute.</p>
<p>And then they cast off and rowed away toward
their own vessel, making such speed as they
could; but unfortunately they had delayed too
long. The simoon struck us like a blow and
the <i>Seagull</i> keeled over at a dangerous angle
and trembled through every beam.</p>
<p>As I clung desperately to the rail my eyes
followed the Turkish gig, and I saw its prow
rise from the water as the whirling cloud of
mingled wind and sand caught it, and dump its
occupants&mdash;officers, men and all&mdash;into the now
seething flood. Yes, the treasure went, too&mdash;the
priceless historic papyri, the golden ornaments
and splendid jewels of the great priests
of Karnak&mdash;all, all were swallowed up by the
waters and vanished forever from the sight of
men!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<p>The wrecked gig was only a mass of splinters.
They shot life-lines from the deck of the cruiser
and these were clutched by those of the boat&rsquo;s
crew who rose again to the surface. But I cannot
say how many of those ill-fated Turks were
finally rescued. For we had our own ship&rsquo;s
safety to look after, and when the dreadful
simoon had subsided, which it did as suddenly
as it had appeared, but after several hours of
terror, the Khedive&rsquo;s man-o&rsquo;-war was but a dim
speck upon the horizon, and soon we had lost
sight of her altogether.</p>
<p>When, the strain being at last over, we met
together in the main cabin for supper, it was
a dismal enough lot of faces that surrounded
the table. Except Joe. Joe did not seem dismal
at all. He smiled upon us most cheerfully,
until we all hated the boy for his good nature
under such trying circumstances.</p>
<p>No one, however, cared to mention our great
loss&mdash;which was in everyone&rsquo;s mind&mdash;except
Archie, who growled out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in thunder couldn&rsquo;t the simoon have
arrived an hour or so earlier, before we were
robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we chose not to heed the wail. Fate has
her own way of ordaining things.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>I rose abruptly and passed into my cabin, and
to my surprise Joe followed. As he lighted my
lamp and turned up the wick so that it illumined
the room brightly, I heard him whistling softly
to himself.</p>
<p>The boy annoyed me, and I turned upon him
rather savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem quite content to have lost your
inheritance,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but the rest of us are
not so well satisfied. Can&rsquo;t you try to respect
our feelings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He grinned at me most provokingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strikes me we&rsquo;ve got something yet to be
thankful for, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The Turks didn&rsquo;t
bag so much treasure as they thought they did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stared at him with sudden interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped to my bunk and drew back the
curtains. Then he threw aside the blanket and
disclosed the berth heaped full with glittering
jewels and golden ornaments that sparkled
brightly under the clear rays of the lamp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>My cry brought the others running hastily
into the room, but as their gaze followed my
own and fell upon the mass of treasure they
stood mute and still, filled with a wonder that
fairly dulled their senses.</p>
<p>At last Uncle Naboth tumbled into a chair
and began mopping his forehead with his red
silk handkerchief, and I awoke far enough to
ask, in an awed whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it happen, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it was dead easy, Sam,&rdquo; he replied
with a laugh. &ldquo;As soon as that infernal gunboat
fired at us I knew something had to be done
to save the treasure. So I ran down here and
ripped open the seams at the bottom of all those
canvas sacks, and dumped about three-quarters
of the contents of each one of &rsquo;em into your
berth. I left some of the stuff in the ends of
the sacks that were tied and sealed, so if the
Egyptians opened any of &rsquo;em they&rsquo;d think they
were still loaded all the way down with jewelry.
Then I had to fill up the spaces, and that was
harder than you&rsquo;d think. I first chucked in all
the old bits of iron and brass I could find in
the junk-chest; but that wasn&rsquo;t near enough.
So I ran to the galley and got Bry to give me
a lot of potatoes and a bag of beans. With
these I filled up the treasure sacks and then
sewed up all the seams again. It took some time
to do this, and the only way I could hide the
treasure was to cover it up with this blanket
and draw the curtains. Mebbe I wasn&rsquo;t scared
stiff when the officers came down here! But
they never thought to search the bunk in this
cabin, though they went through all the others.
I&rsquo;m sorry, sir, I didn&rsquo;t empty the bags entirely,
for they never opened any of &rsquo;em; but I thought
it was best not to take too many chances, and
I guess we&rsquo;ve saved about two-thirds of all the
treasure we brought from the desert&mdash;except,
of course, the rolls of writing, and those we
didn&rsquo;t care so much for, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the boy had finished this speech
he was the focus of all our admiring eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about what&rsquo;s lost, Joe,&rdquo; said
Uncle Naboth, earnestly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough left
to make us all rich; an&rsquo; we owe it to your
pluck and wit&mdash;an&rsquo; to nothin&rsquo; else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three cheers for Joe!&rdquo; yelled Archie, joyously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Joe, flushing red, &ldquo;what else
was there to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Three weeks after we anchored safely in Boston
harbor, and before many days had passed
Uncle Naboth&rsquo;s prediction was amply fulfilled.
The proceeds of the treasure made us all, in
our humble stations, &ldquo;rich,&rdquo; and Joe&rsquo;s share,
being so much the largest, made him very rich
indeed.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p class="pg">Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p class="pg">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p class="pg">While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p class="pg">International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p class="pg">Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p class="pg">Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p class="pg">Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p class="pg">Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p class="pg">This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
